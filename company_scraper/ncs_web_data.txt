                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  The Singapore maritime industry contributes about 7% of the nation’s GDP. Playing a crucial role in the global supply chain, Singapore is reputed to be one of the world’s leading hub ports  and busiest container transhipment hubs. Its strategic location, along one of the world’s busiest shipping waterways , paves the way for international business investments in Asia.  However, our Maritime industry has not prospered without its challenges. Limited sea space, ever-increasing vessel traffic and size, higher safety and efficiency expectations – these are just a few of the growing pool of difficulties faced. How can our ports embrace digitalisation and evolve into Smart Ports; automated, efficient and fully-integrated? In the webcast on  , NCS Industry Lead for Transport, Goh Kwong Heng, speaks to 2 maritime industry experts on the challenges and opportunities ports encounter on the journey towards increased digitalisation. Tan Wee Meng (Chief Technical Officer and Chief Sustainability Officer, Jurong Port) and Oh Bee Lock (Chief Executive Officer, Singapore Logistics Association) elaborate on how to advance port operations and technology, data driven smart ports and post-COVID-19 smart port operations, including digitalisation and technological trends and the demand for new skill sets.  With the formation of mega alliances and the increase in the size of ships and volume arriving into Singapore’s ports, major pain points for the transport logistics sector are the physical space and infrastructure available. In the same vein, there has also been an increase in demand for greater operations productivity due to compressed vessel turnaround times. To illustrate this, Bee Lock explains how as of January 2021, less than 40% of ships arrive on schedule. This means that more ships are arriving together, in addition to holding twice as much cargo. To top it all off, the COVID-19 pandemic has induced further congestion in key logistics nodes, limited cargo movement, and manpower constraints. It has been equally strenuous for port operators such as Jurong Port even though they started their digitalisation journey a significant time back. Wee Meng shares how Jurong Port handles both general cargo and bulk cargo, and how the challenges in both areas differ. This stems from the fact that the nature of the cargo is different; bulk cargo unloading can be mechanised to a much greater degree than general cargo unloading. As such, Jurong Port faces difficulties due to their high dependence on manual labour which compromised their productivity, different handling gears, stowage arrangement, and how stowage information is transmitted. In light of such challenges, NCS holds a Smart Port vision for enhancing connectivity, efficiency, productivity, safety, and user experience through a digital conversion of the maritime sector and the development of next-generation port systems. NCS’ perspective is that port transformation, through digitalisation, and the associated opportunities made available as a result, are not just necessary but viable. Kwong Heng describes how Smart Port Transformation can be split into two subsets - Smart Maritime Operations and Smart Container Terminals. The end goal for both is to boost the overall efficiency and productivity of port operations. Smart Maritime Operations targets improving user experience and safety of the port. Smart Container Terminals, on the other hand, aims at increasing labour productivity, port connectivity, and customer base. To achieve both outcomes, NCS has identified key thrusts for each, which comprise of the employment of various new capabilities such as:  Technologies to support the aforementioned capabilities are also proposed, such as: This webcast also explores some key enablers that are essential for Smart Port Transformation. As we transition into the new norm of today’s digitalised world, it has become apparent that we need to be innovative, collaborative, and most importantly, digitally savvy. Bee Lock shares that key enablers which catalyse this transformation are organisational agility, technological capability & resources, digital vision & strategy, and culture. All four of these enablers capitalise on the need to have a digital quotient (DQ), in addition to the conventional IQ and EQ, as it opens the doors for data fluency. The three industry experts also discuss the need for a Data Driven Smart Port, and how organisations can leverage their data to make smarter decisions for better business outcomes. We get insights into how port operators, such as Jurong Port, utilise data analytics to make the port more intelligent. For instance, Wee Meng explains how Jurong Port is in the process of developing a digital twin based on big data collected from the port. This digital twin will ultimately help to make scheduling of cargo flowing in and out of the port more efficient, thereby resolving any potential major congestion. Data Driven Smart Ports hint at a promising future where operations will be optimised to be more cost and time-efficient. Naturally, the discussion also considers the ravaging effects and challenges caused by COVID-19, and how port operators and the logistics industry are overcoming those challenges. Using the NCS 3 lenses to view digitalisation in a post-COVID-19 world – Retaining Freedom, Restoring Security and Rebalancing Touch, we recognise how the port industry is steadily steering through the pandemic and emerging victorious with the aid of digital transformation.  To glean the full depth of invaluable insights from these industry experts, watch the Smart Port Transformation Webcast      :  Share this article on: Discover how you can chart your career and elevate your skills.

How AI can take optimised healthcare resource utilisation to the next level | NCS SG how   can take optimised healthcare resource utilisation to the next level Contact Us Thank you for your interest. Healthcare facilities are looking to artificial intelligence to optimise operational performance at a time when rising demand for their services is stretching resources and limiting the patient experience. Singapore-based ICT service provider NCS has responded with a platform that brings AI to the heart of a more responsive operational model. Challenges for healthcare providers Leveraging AI to address these challenges Looking to the future explore more 
                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Improving operational efficiency has emerged as a priority for healthcare facilities as they seek predictive ways to manage and allocate resources at a time of ever-increasing demand for their services. Many of them are now turning to AI as a key enabler of a more progressive approach, helping them to plan their logistical responses based on the latest data – and maintain their focus on delivering end-to-end patient care of the highest quality. A growing patient load creates significant operational challenges, not least for the management of the patient experience itself. For example, where appointment schedules are not properly optimised, the disruption to patient flow throughout a facility can have a significant impact on waiting times. Providers need to be able to sustain a consistent flow of patients and visitors, and meet it with appropriate resources, including clinical staff, hospital beds and operating theatres, at every stage of the patient journey. If these challenges are not dealt with adequately, the operational consequences can mount up: dissatisfied patients, and inefficient and expensive resource utilisation. Inconsistent patient flows create long queues at more congested points. Other service locations stand idle while still consuming power and human resources as they wait for patients to come through. In response to this typical situation, data scientists from NCS’ AI team have built a schedule optimisation tool – the Enterprise Schedule Optimisation Platform – that demonstrates how AI can plan more effectively than humans as the demand for healthcare services grows. Healthcare administrators can only engage with a limited number of data points simultaneously. But AI can compute exponential permutations from a practically limitless source of data points, building predictive models that enable real-time operational response from the provider as well as helping them to plan future resource allocation. This concept is now being developed at the   (SNEC), which has partnered with NCS to design, build and deploy a new Appointment Scheduling Optimiser (ASO). Easy to configure by trained business users, the ASO will transform the clinic’s operations, reducing patient waiting times and allocating resources more efficiently. "Currently, appointment scheduling for all patient visits including those requiring initial consultations and the necessary same-day eye services and investigations is a time and labour-intensive process handled by appointment staff," says Jim Gu, SNEC’s chief operating officer. "To address the growing volume of appointment requests and limited visibility over demand at multiple service stations resulting in bottlenecks and long clinic waiting times, SNEC collaborated with NCS to leverage the ASO to resolve the various pain points." The new approach disrupts the traditional mindset of taking patients’ exact preferences for specific dates and appointment times, gathering instead more general preferences from patients who are due for appointments within a particular timeframe. Using NCS’ AI technology, advanced analytics and machine learning capabilities, the scheduler will consider these inputs as well as resource variables – clinician schedules and availability, types of service, facility availability – and objectively generate an optimal schedule. The ASO will also be responsive to real-time changes, re-optimising schedules to accommodate events such as patient no-shows or unavailable resources. This level of versatility combined with the ASO’s ability to maintain optimised scheduling in response to rapid shifts in service demand makes for a powerful AI-fuelled proposition.  vision for healthcare digitalisation is based on the idea that AI is a key driver, which can bring a comprehensive range of benefits to every aspect of healthcare services. These benefits are already being realised on a number of fronts, from robotic nursing assistants and fall-prevention solutions to intelligent speech and sentiment recognition for call centres, and video analytics solutions for managing security and social distancing enforcement. "AI is a key catalyst in ushering a new paradigm where healthcare providers can leverage it as a productivity multiplier to continue to deliver sustainable, quality healthcare services and further improve the patient experience in the face of rising costs and limited healthcare resources," says Daniel Ng, Enterprise Architect, Healthcare at NCS. “AI in healthcare is most effective when it sets out with the intention to support, and not supplant, the patient-doctor relationship. Many of the algorithms we employ today are well known in the AI world. Only when it enhances our healthcare workers’ ability to focus their hearts and minds on patients – by abstracting the transactional or computationally complex tasks responsibly – can they then find their place as healthcare solutions,” says Yong Xu Chang, Practice Lead for Applied Analytics at NCS.

                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Maritime Singapore is one of the world’s busiest container hub ports, and the fifth largest ship registry in the world. It is home to over 5,000 maritime establishments and 130 international shipping groups. But after decades of operation, the maritime sector must evolve to address new challenges. Vessels are getting larger, and there are more of them than ever before. Ports aim to turn ships around in the same period of time, despite much higher volumes of cargo. What’s more, the increased size and number of ships will put great demands on Singapore’s limited sea space. In addition, Maritime Singapore must respond to disruptive technologies and business models, increasing manpower constraints, and rising expectations around safety standards and efficiency. On top of that, the seaport is under pressure to reduce its carbon footprint and become more sustainable. The consolidation of container terminals in the city to Tuas Port is an ideal opportunity to reinvent Singapore’s maritime industry for the digital age. The new port could adopt an innovative operating concept and cutting-edge technologies to enable next-generation port operations. This will help Singapore cement its position as a leading port, even as global competition intensifies. In this paper, we will examine what a smart port could look like, explore use cases, discover examples of innovation in action, and explain why NCS is well-positioned to deliver smart ports. Leading ports across the world are aspiring to transform their operations. Their goal is to become smart ports levering on digitalisation and automation. Our smart port vision focuses on enhancing port safety and efficiency, boosting productivity and delivering better customer experiences. We achieve this through digitisation, automation and the development of next-generation port systems. The idea is that when ships call at the port, they should not have to wait at the anchorage and take up limited sea space. Instead, the port can immediately dispatch a pilot to bring the ships to berth, for cargo operations to commence immediately. The port provides just-in-time services for bunkering, provision of water and supplies, minor repairs, and the changing of the crew. After a quick turnaround, the ship can continue on its way. Let’s delve deeper into the main use-cases to better understand how NCS can help port operators transform this vision into reality. To enhance port user experience, there should be a digital platform to streamline all transactions such as vessel, immigration and port clearances that each vessel needs to fulfil when it arrives at the port; and enable secure cross-border data sharing making the port 100% paperless, saving hundreds of thousands of person-hours each year. Blockchain technology has a great potential to transform the port industry in a big way. For example, having a Secured Maritime Application Realtime Transactions (SMART) platform to replace physical certificates for ship registrations and seafarers with tamper-proof eCertificates will generate significant savings for ship owners, port authorities, and seafarers world-wide.  SMART can also be applied in the bunkering sector to reduce paperwork, enhance transparency and security of sharing critical information among the stakeholders. To become a smart port also means the ability to derive maximum value from the big data that one has. A data-driven port can leverage advanced analytics for sense-making such as automated detection of vessel movements to pinpoint infringements, hotspots and near-misses.  Using powerful video analytics, ports can automatically detect oil spillages, smoke pollution and illegal activities. With the proliferation of drone applications, it is expected that marine drones will be deployed increasingly in the near future, for instance in ship-to-shore deliveries and remote ship inspections to minimise human contact during a pandemic. A fully integrated port operations require a common situation awareness picture to be shared among all operational units within the organisation.  This can be achieved by setting up a port digital twin to facilitate effective management of marine incidents, marine enforcement, and deployment of next generation vessel traffic management system with e-navigation capability. In the past few years, we have been awarded several major projects by the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA). These have enabled us to accumulate expertise in the maritime industry. We helped MPA to develop and deploy a one-stop portal – digitalPORT@SG™ – that enables shipping companies to submit all port clearance documentation to different government agencies in one submission. This makes it much easier for shipping companies to meet regulatory reporting requirements and save the shipping community around 100,000 man-hours a year. These huge efficiency gains sparked swift uptake of the new portal – with 100% of port clearance submitted via the new digitalPORT@SG™ within a year of its launch. This new system will also help the government agencies achieve better port operations and coordination while optimising each ship’s time within our port waters. Faster processing also enables the port to clear more vessels and increase traffic throughput – boosting the maritime sector’s performance and strengthening Singapore’s standing in the global maritime industry as an efficient global hub port. We built a new centralised data hub, Singapore Maritime Data Hub (SG-MDH), that enables shipping companies and government agencies to share maritime open data. This includes information on the vessel itself, its location, movement, arrival and departure times. SG-MDH was the world’s first open data-sharing platform established by a port authority. It has given developers a powerful platform for building new applications to support the maritime industry. For example, start-up Claritecs has used the platform to build an app for scheduling just-in-time bunker deliveries. Another start-up, SG Smart Tech, has developed a boat ride hailing app. We envisage that there is also potential to use SG-MDH to develop a maritime digital map for emergency responses, a sea space utilisation map, and more efficient ship-to-shore communications. In January 2020, SG-MDH won the Ministry of Transport’s Minister’s Innovation Award for its impact on the maritime industry. To date, more than 230 developers and 51 organisations have signed up for SG-MDH. The platform paves the way for more data-sharing between government agencies and the industry, including opportunity for extending it to other national governments. A key component of our smart port offering is our proprietary Ship Height Detection System (SHDS). It provides automated detection, tracking and height check of vessels entering and departing Cruise Bay Area. SHDS is a hybrid smart system utilising automatic identification system, low light cameras with advanced PTZ (Pan, Tilt, Zoom) platform and laser sensors to locate and detect vessel over-height. The built-in video analytics algorithm enables reliable automatic vessel height detection during vessel crossing whether it’s day or night, and under challenging weather conditions. This sophisticated system generates huge value-added benefits for smart ports. It boosts operational productivity, by accurately measuring ship heights and provides early warning and alarm to relevant parties. Most importantly, it improves safety of overhanging structures across key waterways. NCS is uniquely positioned to deliver smart ports. We have end-to-end capabilities to: By leveraging our expertise in the maritime industry and technical domains, we can work with clients to dive deep into specific smart port areas to conceptualise next-generation systems. We can also partner with customers to co-create new innovative solution concepts through POCs and ideation. Furthermore, we can generate new use-cases and industry applications for NCS solutions.

                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  “Remote work is here to stay.” That is an often-heard refrain among business leaders and HR professionals peering forward into the post-COVID-19 era. Forced to have their staff work from home (WFH) during the global COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns, businesses have seen the flexibility and efficiencies that WFH or remote working can bring. This change presents opportunities for organisations to transform their culture and ride the wave to be more agile and efficient, and not revert to old inefficient rigid practices. But yet some leaders rue the loss of the ‘good old days’ where everyone worked from the office, and they were ‘seen, heard and present’. While the future of work will see the rise of more remote work, the impact of COVID-19 has a wider and deeper implication than merely a question of “Should my workforce come back to the office or should they continue to WFH?” How should Business and HR leaders then build upon the lessons that the COVID-19 pandemic thrust upon their organisations and emerge as more competitive? Pre-COVID-19, the default was to have most of our people work from the office, and the fortunate ones who were granted the flexibility to WFH were the exceptions. During the COVID-19 period, the reverse happened; WFH was the default and those who had to return to the office or was granted permission formed the exception. Post-COVID-19, it’s not useful to think of this dichotomy of office versus WFH and set HR policies around that. Rather we should be asking,  Now, this requires a significant cultural shift anchored on the elements of trust and empowerment. This also has to be supported by enlightened leadership, competent and responsible staff, logistics and technical enablement, and the development of a flexible workforce made up of a new mix of talents on permanent positions and on gigs. Militaries have long had teams operate ‘remotely’ – far from the HQ, in hostile terrain and often operating in a fast-paced and ambiguous environment, and out of physical sight from their HQ. Armies understand the importance of having the last soldier on the ground understand the intent of the mission, as there is no way for the HQ to micromanage the teams on the ground when they are a few hundred kilometres away. Having them understand the purpose of the mission, the training to deliver on it, and the knowledge that HQ will have their backs is key to building trust and having agile teams on the ground that respond quickly to volatile and uncertain situations. Commanders are encouraged to leave their ‘all-seeing, all-hearing’ high-tech command posts and move forward to lead the frontlines to sense (See, Hear, Feel) the battlefield. There, they will get a better sense of the battlefield and readiness of their troops. Organisations will do well to take a leaf from these principles as more of their workforce move between office and remote working, and to wherever the mission requires their presence.  First, Leaders will have to do even more to create a sense of common purpose and direction. This is foundational to build a culture of trust and common direction, allowing the dispersed and remote workforce to march in the same direction regardless of the location of their staff.  To strengthen the social fabric of the organisation, leaders must engage employees in new ways that marry the strengths of a hybrid digital-physical or ‘Phy-gital’ world, where online and face-to-face interactions complement rather than substitute each other. While face-to-face interaction may decline, online communication and sync-up meetings should increase to make up for the loss of informal face-to-face interactions at the workplace. Leaders must regularly communicate directions (the Whys and Whats), encourage dialogue and sharing, and empower their remote teams to develop actions plans to do their jobs (the Hows). Technology allowing that to happen across geographies and time zones has been around for decades, but the COVID-19 pandemic has made people more comfortable with collaboration and even socialising through online platforms. For example, virtual town halls that are able to reach out to thousands across the organisation and not be limited by the size of the auditorium, allows leaders to engage every stratum of the company at one go, flattening communications and speeding up the message getting to the ground. ‘Zoom parties’ enables teams to catch up socially, substituting for the lack of physical interactions. That said, cyber catchups don’t make up the social connection that physical interactions bring. The workplace is a very social environment that runs on the formal and informal relationships between people and the flow of information. Trusting relationships that grow from the watercooler talk, lunch and after-work drinks are important to the social fabric of teams and their cohesion. So, even as organisations see more staff working remotely as a norm, opportunities must be created to allow for these interactions that build trust across teams. These interactions will help employees feel connected with each other and align them closely to a company’s mission.  Leaders too must play their part - by increasing their presence on the shop floor, meeting customers and engaging staff in-person - to build trust, respect and confidence. With this, they can get a better pulse of the company that remote working cannot give. This must complement the opportunities that remote working and video meetings allow for leaders to reach out across all segments of their organisation and not be limited by physical distance. They mustn’t be lulled into the false belief that they too can work remotely to the full extent and be just as effective.  Before COVID-19, companies used rules and supervision to govern behaviour and control their teams. And many of these had KPIs that measured outputs rather than the outcomes. Employee activity was monitored, and performance was measured based on output such as hours at work, dress codes etc. Organisations should move towards evaluating outcomes rather than monitoring the output from their staff. They should measure the desired effects (eg. customer satisfaction scores, cost reductions), rather than the effort and time they put into it (eg. number of hours at the office, meeting with customers, number of new initiatives worked on).  To do this, organisations need to be more diligent in setting clear outcome-based goals and targets for their teams and then empower them to achieve them. This allows the staff to be clear about what is expected of them to meet the purpose of the organisation and also be given space for staff to be where they need to be to achieve the output - whether they feel there are more effective at the office or remotely.  Leaders and staff need to be trained on how to operate effectively in a more flexible and agile way, that in some ways may seem to have less structure and rhythm that a traditional work-from-office regime gives. In traditional office environments, there is a clear delineation of time and space to mark the start and end of work. The presence of authority figures and approval protocols provide structure to the workday. Face-to-face interaction enables the natural development of relationships and facilitates collaboration. Communication and supervision styles were developed to cater for teams in the same location. But in the ‘Phy-gital’ workspace, the shift to a hybrid office-remote system will require a different set of skills for effective management and collaboration.  Moving forward, leaders will need to learn how to lead a decentralised workforce. They will need to learn how to communicate, gather ideas, moderate meetings and align stakeholders in an online environment and know when a face-to-face meeting is required. Managers will need to take the lead in identifying and learning what the most appropriate tools and best practices are for the Phy-gital world. This way, organisations can be equipped with tools that enable them to ideate, strategise and go-to-market quickly.  Everyone in the organisation will have to hone their skills in self-management, digital collaboration and cross-cultural communication. Remote work also requires empowered employees to be disciplined in organising their priorities, managing their time and avoiding distractions.  The post-COVID-19 world has made organisations rethink the resiliency of their workforce in surviving a global crisis. Seemingly robust business continuity plan (BCP) that shifts work and teams to alternate sites in the event of a crisis (eg. shifting outsourced BPO work in India to alternate sites in the Philippines) has proven to be inadequate as the virus hit globally and affected operations even in these locations. Attention has since turned to accelerate the adoption of AI and Robotics Process Automation to replace transactional work, and the workers. Over time, some of such roles will become redundant. Navigating this imminent wave of change requires a deliberate approach to redesign jobs, augment them with technology and reskill staff to operate them.  Beyond technical knowledge, people will also need to develop skills that are difficult for computers to replicate. According to  the top 5 skills companies need are creativity, persuasion, collaboration, adaptability and time management. In high demand but short supply is creativity and innovation. The ability to master the art of solving complex, messy problems and to co-create with others in new and imaginative ways will be much needed to augment technical skills.  The ability to work remotely opens up opportunities for organisations to tap on an even more diverse talent pool globally.  The traditional HR function of talent management focuses on ‘building’ talent - developing and retaining in-house talent. The future of work will see a wider diversity of local and international co-workers available for flexible work arrangements on short contracts or specific task-related gigs. This will be accelerated by the ability to have flexible and remote work arrangements. HR leaders will do well to capitalise on ‘buying’ and ‘borrowing’ talent on top of building their core capabilities with in-house talent. Organisations need to measure their success in talent management not by how much talent they own alone, but also how wide and deep an external inventory of talent they can call on-demand with flexibility. This effort can begin by creating a network of partners and a specific set of freelance workers to tap on when a need arises. With the presence of talent platforms, such as Toptal and Upwork, that play the role of smoothing out the demand and supply of executive talent, companies will find it easier to hire global talent on-demand. To enable this, leaders must trust the quality of work and the ability of the contingent talent to keep confidential information private. Along with this, leaders will have to navigate new ways of managing these relationships. Leaders have to radically rethink the physical and digital touchpoints of their employees.  Organisations will have to double their efforts to improve the digital user experience for employees. Security and user experience will matter for areas such as the signing of contracts, onboarding, e-learning, leave application and accessing of payslips. Forward-looking organisations should begin to shift more transactional activities online and go paperless more aggressively. By providing digital infrastructure and the best user experience for their people and customers, organisations will be able to operate effectively in the new ‘Phy-gital’ world.  In the new normal, workplaces have to be ready for the next pandemic, and hygiene will be a priority and fundamental for employees to trust that it is safe to go to work. The use of contactless technology will accelerate. Touch-free sensors, facial recognition system with control access to rooms and contact tracing will become commonplace as we move towards a low touch environment. With voice search gaining traction, even taking an elevator can become voice-assisted. Workspaces will see a redesign. The trend towards wide open spaces, hotdesking, and shared offices to drive collaboration should not be reversed as they do provide the flexibility and environment for collaborative work. But they must be flexible and modular to convert to smaller and contained spaces when the need calls for it, if and when another pandemic hits. Screens, easily movable furniture and self-sanitising features in the ventilation systems will allow open workspaces to be quickly converted to segmented smaller spaces to mitigate the spread of infections across the floor. Space freed up as a result of the partial workforce working from home will lead to costs savings and can also be converted to collaboration areas.  To seize the opportunities of the ‘Phy-gital’ workplace and tap on the rich source of global talent, trust and empowerment must be the cornerstone of the relationship between organisations, leaders and their talents, regardless of where the team is working.  Leaders must trust that their people are aligned to the corporate purpose and desired outcomes, and be empowered to do their best, whether they are in the office or WFH. They must trust that their team knows what is best and most effective to get the job done. They must reassure, communicate and train their people to be ready for their new world so that the staff will, in turn, be assured of their job security and career progression. They must create a workplace that staff trust and feel safe even in times of crisis and pandemic.  Staff must upskill themselves to be competent and relevant, be disciplined and responsible so that their leaders can trust they can get the job done. With this, the post-COVID-19 world can be an opportunity for organisations to be agile and deliver high performance with an engaged workforce in any location.

Charting The Course For The Port of The Future | NCS SG charting the course for the port of the future Contact Us Thank you for your interest. What is the significance of the maritime sector to Singapore? What are some of the developments that will impact port operators in the coming years? How are port operators responding to operational challenges? What progress are we making in creating the port of the future? explore more 
                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  NCS’s Smart Port vision is about enhancing port efficiency, productivity and customer experiences through the digital transformation of the maritime sector and the development of next-generation port systems.  Seaborne trade makes up over 90 percent of world trade, and this dominance is likely to continue into the foreseeable future. This has significant implications for Singapore as we play a key role in the sea transport ecosystem. Our strategic location along one of the world’s busiest international shipping waterways has contributed to our status as a global hub port. We are one of the busiest ports and transhipment hubs in the world and a leading international maritime centre. We offer reliable and efficient cargo handling and are the top bunkering port in the world. We also provide a wide range of essential marine services including pilotage, towage, freshwater supply, ship supplies, and ship repairs and maintenance services. The maritime sector is thus a key pillar of Singapore's economy, contributing 6% to 7% of our GDP and employing more than 170,000 people. Vessels are getting bigger. Today, we have 20,000 TEU carriers which are about 400 metres in length, so terminal ports around the world will have to ensure that their infrastructure is able to cater to these megaships. At the same time, there is pressure on ports and terminal operators to provide the same level of efficiency and to turn ships around in the same period of time, despite much higher volumes of cargo. In Singapore, operations are further complicated by the fact that we are a transhipment hub. Unlike gateway hubs where the cargo going through is earmarked either for import or export, a large proportion of cargo in a transhipment hub does not go out of the port at all. In Singapore, 85 percent of the cargo is reloaded into smaller vessels for distribution to the region. All these require an effective response to ensure that space, equipment, labour, technology and port services are optimised to cater to the next generation of vessels and the complex operations of a transhipment hub. Another significant development is the emergence of mega shipping alliances. This has changed the dynamics of the relationship between container shipping lines and ports, with shipping lines gaining more influence and bargaining power . This is taking place in a climate of heightened competition in the port-operating landscape. Regional hub ports in Malaysia and Indonesia are taking steps to upgrade and build new facilities and improve their service levels to ensure that they continue to be relevant and competitive. Further afield, the ports of Shanghai, Busan, Rotterdam and Hamburg are also expanding their capacity with new facilities in a bid to increase their container throughput. All these steps are being taken to attract the mega alliances, especially in the container market segment where their decisions regarding capacity deployed, ports of call and network structure can determine the fate of a container port terminal. When an alliance makes a decision on their hub port, they could bring with them five or six shipping operators, which will contribute a significant percentage to container throughput. In the face of growing operational pressures and heightened competition, port operators are turning to technology for answers. With Industry 4.0 and the ongoing digital transformation drive, container terminals are investing in higher levels of automation to improve productivity and efficiency and secure a competitive advantage. Key technologies that come into play include the Internet of Things, advanced analytics, robotics, artificial intelligence (AI), unmanned vehicles and equipment, and blockchain. For example, in transhipment operations, it is that the unloading of cargo follows a sequence that ensures optimal efficiency when it has to be reloaded onto another vessel. Given the volume of transhipment cargo handled by Singapore, the planning is too complex to be carried out manually, so terminal operators are applying intelligent algorithms to ensure that optimal efficiency is achieved. Going forward, AI and machine learning will embed themselves into planning tools to help continuously improve these algorithms. There is also an increase in the use of smart sensors, which will help pave the way for fully-automated operations. For example, accurate smart cameras sensors placed on top of a crane can help pinpoint the exact location of a container that is to be picked up. With minimal human intervention, the sensor-guided crane can be positioned to pick up the cargo, instead of having a human operator to manipulate the crane. There is, however, still some way to go before full automation can be achieved in terminal operations. For yard cranes which pick up containers from trucks and put them into storage and vice versa, a high degree of automation is already possible. In ports like Shanghai and Rotterdam, automated guided vehicles (AGVs) – specially built vehicles with no drivers - are already being deployed to transfer containers from trucks to storage and vice versa. In Singapore, a trial of AGVs is currently being conducted at the Pasir Panjang terminal. However, with the quay crane, it is still quite difficult to achieve a high level of automation. The quay crane transfers containers to or from a ship, and because there may be some movement in the water, loading or unloading operations could be delayed if the camera sensor is not accurate enough. We will thus require much more accurate sensors, combined with intelligent algorithms to do the final adjustments before this segment of terminal operations can be more highly automated. How can we address the challenge of heightened competition and the emergence of mega-alliances? To stay ahead of the competition, it is essential for port operators to maintain and even improve on their customer service. This goes beyond ensuring operational efficiency to delivering just-in-time (JIT) arrival and services. The idea is that when ships come to port, they should not have to wait at the anchorage and incur a cost for port use. Instead, a pilot vessel can be dispatched straight away to bring the ship directly to berth and cargo operations can commence immediately. JIT services involve a whole spectrum of stakeholders including those involved in bunkering services, the provision of water and supplies, minor repairs, and the changing of the crew. All these activities will have to happen once the ship berths at the dock. To achieve this, there has to be a digitalisation push involving all the different stakeholders – the terminal operator, bunker supplier, water supplier and others - so that they will be able to come together to share critical information. For example, the creation of a digital platform such as a Port Digital Twin can help enhance situational awareness for terminal and marine operations. The digital twin will be able to predict traffic congestion hotspots within the terminal and port waters and, by applying modelling and simulation techniques, generate optimal solutions to help port operators and authorities resolve problems proactively, minimising disruption to port users. Another technology that is being explored to enhance customer service is the use of drones. Instead of hiring a boat to deliver documents, goods, medical aids and even cash to a vessel, drones are being trialled to transport these light-weight goods from shore to ship. A highly automated smart port with high density of connected devices, will require a high-performance wireless connectivity to connect port processes and support seamless information flow within the port ecosystem. Emerging technology such as 5G has great potential for deployment in the terminals and port waters to maximise operational efficiency and sustainability and unlock the possibilities of developing innovative port applications. NCS’ Smart Port vision is to enhance operational efficiency, productivity, safety and security, and port connectivity through the digital transformation of the maritime sector and the development of next-generation port systems. It is crucial for us to stay ahead of the curve. Advanced ports around the world including Hamburg, Rotterdam, Dubai and Shanghai are starting to leverage automation and digital technologies to enhance operational efficiency, productivity, and the customer experience. Singapore is also exploring transformation opportunities as we look to our Next Generation Port 2030  Under the masterplan, container handling operations will be consolidated at a single location in Tuas, from the existing City and Pasir Panjang terminals. This will provide an opportunity for the port operator, the research and technology communities, and businesses to come together to leverage digital and automation technologies and new land-use ideas. The first few berths of the Tuas Next Generation Port will commence operations in 2021 and the port will eventually reach a planned capacity of 65M TEUs by 2040. NCS is working closely with government agencies, technology partners and key stakeholders to prepare for this move. In co-developing concepts, building POCs and rolling out our Smart Port applications, we aim to create innovative next-generation systems that will help shape the port of the future, right here in Singapore.    KEYNOTE SPEECH BY MR ANDREW TAN, CHIEF EXECUTIVE, MARITIME AND PORT AUTHORITY OF SINGAPORE ON THE "NEXT GENERATION PORT 2030" AT THE SMI FORUM, 22ND OCTOBER 2015, 0930AM, THE STAR GALLERY  NCS SG, Practice Director, Maritime Share this article on: Discover how you can chart your career and elevate your skills Find available positions and join our multi-talented team.

                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  COVID-19 has driven the world’s biggest shift to remote working to date. And it’s time to acknowledge that moving forward, working from home will be one of the new norm. Many Singaporean employers were caught off guard when the official Circuit Breaker measures were first announced. There was little time for a gradual transition and companies had to somehow support a fully remote workforce within a few days. Supporting a fully remote workforce - on this scale - is new to many companies. So, what do some businesses have that others lack when it comes to implementing remote work arrangements? We’ve heard of many success stories like Google or Facebook, which recently announced that their employees will be allowed to work from home for the rest of the year. It seems simple for these companies to carry out such measures, but why? In the last month alone, NCS has empowered thousands of employees to transition from a mostly office-bound environment to a decentralised work from home environment. Here are some learnings and best practices in preparing for this new normal of working from home. The key considerations for enabling work-from-home (WFH) for your business revolves around the capacity of the business for a distributed work operations. A useful way to look at this is to ask: The extent to which you can adopt a WFH model depends on how far you can advance in each of these areas. If your processes are still heavily paper dependent, then it could be beneficial to quickly see how you can digitise them at the edge and at the core. An organisation running on digitalised processes is inherently better able to function in a WFH model. Similarly, if your workforce is already conversant with collaboration tools, they will be better equipped to WFH. And underpinning all this, is to have a robust cybersecurity plan to manage the risks that arise in a WFH landscape. Our current approach has proven successful in enabling thousands of NCS employees with the resources and ability to work from home effectively and safely. To find out how you can implement remote working for your organisation, get in touch with us. As an organisation, we had the benefit of a highly digital-savvy team who is familiar with working remotely. We also had the benefit of having many of our operations already digitalised. Hence our primary challenge in rapidly enabling a full WFH environment was infrastructural in nature. The challenge of rapidly scaling up our networks and VPNs to enable WFH for our sizable workforce of more than 9,000 employees. Being the leading ICT service provider in Singapore and supporting essential service providers in the public sector, this was a critical challenge we had to step up to, in order to ensure business continuity for ourselves and our clients. Our team of infrastructure engineers and technical management talents rallied to the cause, and we rapidly scaled up our connectivity infrastructure: 1. Our VPN capabilities were boosted 2.

With passenger volume at MBCCS set to grow, SCCS took steps to prevent possible congestion at various touchpoints of the passenger at the cruise centre.  SCCS requires a solution to allow them to have situational awareness of the passenger traffic movement and queues for security and crowd control. We deployed a secured and seamless solution comprising of smart sensors and cameras orchestrated via a central command and control centre. The smart sensors and cameras were strategically installed across check-in terminal and baggage handling areas to monitor passenger traffic, detect bottlenecks and issues in real-time. In addition, smart sensors were also installed in the terminal’s washrooms to monitor the cleanliness level (real-time updates) to enhance the overall experiences of its passengers. Insights gathered from the smart devices were used to optimise resource planning, improve operational efficiency and tighten the security of the terminal. For instance, when the check-in queue is slow-moving, the system will automatically trigger an alert to operators so that they can respond immediately by opening more counters.  Alerts will also be sent to operators to attend to emergency incidents.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  “20-minute towns and a 45-minute city” – this is the long-term vision of Singapore’s Land Transport Master Plan 2040, where commuters and road users will be able to reach their destinations quickly and conveniently through well-connected walk, cycle or ride transport options. The transport system will be inclusive, providing support for the elderly, disabled, expectant mothers and family with strollers. And it will operate in a safer, healthier and more livable environment with clean energy fleets, more covered link-ways, new technology for safety. Digital technology and innovation will play a significant role in realising these goals and providing safe and seamless connectivity and services for commuters and road users. Today, seamless connectivity remains elusive with limited options for multi-modal real-time recommendations. Services are rigid with public transport buses following fixed schedules and plying mainly fixed routes. Other challenges encountered by the transport sector include manpower shortage and silo-ed systems which prevent information from being shared. As a result, insights are fragmented and transportation planning is based more on historical analysis and less on real-time interventions. But all these could soon change. Today, there are four key pillars of emerging technologies that have the potential to address the challenges of today. Working in tandem, they can help shape the future of land transport. The first pillar is autonomy. Autonomous vehicles such as buses and cars will play a key role in the future of land transport, addressing challenges such as a shortage of drivers, rigid time tables and inflexible routes. Autonomous capabilities are closely intertwined with connectivity and intelligence. For example, 5G allows for information to be streamed almost in real-time to provide precise public bus locations and estimated arrival times and real-time dynamic traffic management. These operational insights and decision support capabilities, when fed into an AI model, pave the way for the creation of innovative new services such as autonomous public bus services that respond dynamically to demand, or dynamic routing based on traffic conditions and crowding. Other automation possibilities in the area of land transport include the remote operation of drones and robots to enable applications such as maintenance inspection and last-mile delivery. The second technology pillar that will be key to the future of land transport is intelligence – advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and the movement of AI and analytics to the edge. Take the case of video, for example. Instead of a conventional video analytics architecture where video streams from cameras are streamed back to servers to be analysed, the trend is towards edge intelligence and a decentralised architecture where video streams are analysed inside the cameras themselves. This enables the infrastructure to keep up with the growing volume of surveillance network traffic and handle video more efficiently. It also reduces the latency between event and response. For example, if the video camera on an autonomous vehicle detects an object in front of it, localised intelligence which combines analytics and machine learning, together with automation capabilities, can lead to a swift response, for example, sounding an alert and applying the brakes. Another development in the intelligence space is the AI-powered IoT platform which allows for a consolidated view of IoT devices and environmental conditions to support decision making. The platform will also feature machine learning technology which will enable it to automatically identify patterns and detect anomalies, and take proactive action. One possible application of this is traffic management, where the IoT portal provides a consolidated view of connected vehicles and other smart objects on the road. Using machine learning technology, the system will be able to detect if there is, for example, congestion due to an accident. This will trigger a timely response, such as mobilising towing services and updating electronic signage in the vicinity to divert traffic to other routes. The inputs from sensors, combined with AI and machine learning capabilities, thus provide insights for informed decision-making and timely, automated responses. This can be applied to improve traffic and enforcement management, develop smart parking solutions, enhance crowd detection and enable predictive maintenance. The third pillar is connectivity. We envisage that there will be a 5G-led transformation of land transport systems leading to the emergence of connected vehicles, IOT-enabled smart infrastructure and smart roads, and the ability to crowd-source for real-time information updates and recommendations. 5G promises to deliver higher speed, density and availability at ultra-low latency. This enables near real-time streaming, processing and optimisation controls for a vast number of IOT devices, transport vehicles and infrastructure. One major use case for this would be autonomous driving. With the low latency of 5G networks, the safety of autonomous vehicles can be enhanced with road hazard and accident avoidance systems which are capable of detecting hazards and triggering an automated response almost in real-time. 5G also paves the way for improved facilities and service innovation such as connected buses and bus stops, in-vehicle infotainment and shopping, detection of illegal parking and real-time discovery of parking availability. The fourth key technology pillar for the future of land transport is security. With increased connectivity and autonomy, the domains of IT and operational technology (OT) have started to overlap. This has implications for the safety and security of land transport systems. For example, cyber attacks can exploit security loopholes in an operational rail transit system to disrupt services. Or attackers can use these loopholes as a channel to infiltrate enterprise networks. The use of AI-led automation technologies will enable the land transport sector to proactively manage these cyber threats. For example, Advanced Security Operations Centres empowered by advanced threat intelligence, cybersecurity analytics and machine learning capabilities will be able to detect and defend against threats to both IT and OT systems. They can carry out effective triaging and threat detection, user behavioural analysis, threat anticipation, incident analysis /investigation and automated proactive incident response such as SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation and Response). The four pillars of technology will continue to evolve and transform Singapore’s land transport landscape. Over the next 5-10 years, we envisage the emergence of driver-less pods to ferry commuters within the Central Business District, Orchard Road, One-North and the universities. At the new Tengah car-free town, a new underground people mover will enable commuters to get around quickly and safely. More drones and robots will be used for last mile-delivery and to enhance surveillance, inspection and maintenance works. With advanced connectivity, intelligence, automation and security, land transport will become more efficient, seamless and safer.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  The Vessel Height Measurement System 4 (VHMS4) is a fully automated system which provides detection, tracking and height measurement of passing sea vessels along the straits. The one-of-a-kind system provides real-time height information of vessels to the air traffic control centre to warn low-flying aircraft approaching and departing the airports – collision avoidance. To reduce the risk of collision of low-flying aircraft approaching and departing the airports, CAAS took steps to ensure the air traffic control centre receives precise information to warn low-flying aircraft of tall vessels near the airport. They required a solution to provide accurate real-time information on vessel height within the straits of the airports. We deployed a system comprising of Electro-Optical (EO) and video analytics with an intelligent vessel filtering algorithm on a single platform to help CAAS to manage multiple sites (airports) with one operator. The in-house developed video EO system accurately detects the vessel height 24/7 (Patent pending). The precise calibration of the EO system and components  provided real-time updates to the air traffic control centre to warn low-flying aircraft of high vessels which may be in their flight path.

                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  Like its counterparts around the world, National Gallery Singapore (NGS) has been exploring technology-enabled innovations to engage new and existing audiences. Specifically, the Gallery sought out digital transformation to overcome long-standing challenges like non-interactive audio tours, availability of docent-led experiences, and making art accessible to all. With the common goal of using technology to “make tomorrow inclusive”, NCS and NGS jointly created a novel AI guide that can communicate with visitors intelligently. The proof of concept (POC) leverages NEXT gpt, a flexible and open orchestration platform that allows developers to accelerate the development of Generative AI applications based on Large Language Models (LLM). This successful POC phase unveils the potential of Generative AI to revolutionise how people—from connoisseurs to general public— engage with art and history in museums. There are gaps to bridge in a typical museum visit. Traditional audio guides lack engagement as they only provide one-way communication. While human guides (or docents) are highly valuable, their availability can be constrained by fixed schedules and language barriers. Also, audiences may not connect well with an audio guide or docent due to differing communication styles, or they may be uncomfortable asking questions in a group setting. Thus, there was a need for the Gallery to develop a solution that adapts to a broad spectrum of visitors and their communication preferences, while providing interactive tours that make art and history accessible and relatable to even those who are not familiar with art.  With a holistic approach encompassing Customer Experience Strategy, Experience Design Behavioural Science, and on-site User Testing, NCS developed an initial prototype of a novel AI Guide (or AI Docent) in the form of a mobile application. This intelligent guide provides a hyper-personalised, interactive and inclusive experience to each and every visitor, with the ability to engage in conversation and provide nuanced responses to questions. 
The solution, which leverages NEXTgpt, comprises of: With NCS’s deep expertise in custom hyper-accurate automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems such as ins8.ai, it is possible for an LLM as such to master multiple languages, accents and colloquial expressions.   •    
Visitors can decide the delivery of the content in terms of depth and style, with suggestions provided based on the user’s profile and preferences.   •     
The AI guide provides information about exhibits and answers questions from visitors in a conversational manner. By understanding contextual data, the guide provides accurate, new and non-repeated information to visitors every time.  •    
Visitors can also choose text-based interactions if audio is not a viable modality.  
   The AI Guide is a revolutionary departure from conventional visitor engagement style and serves as a beacon for future museum experiences.  In a comprehensive two-week visitor testing period, participants demonstrated great receptiveness, embracing the personal AI guide for its personalised interactions. “Very intuitive”, “strong richness of content” and “helps me spend more time at a painting and appreciate it more” were some of the positive comments gathered after the trial.  The guide’s ability to engage in conversations helped maintain users’ curiosity and sparked interests in art and history. By having a distinct persona, the guide evoked a sense of presence and personability expected of a museum tour experience.  By making appreciation of art and history accessible and relatable to one and all, NCS and NGS are a step closer to “making tomorrow inclusive and inspiring”, our shared objective for the AI Guide and a productivity-boosting content creation solution to come. “With National Gallery Singapore’s mission to be a progressive museum that creates dialogues between the art of Singapore, Southeast Asia and the world, NCS’ AI Guide becomes an exciting yet natural extension for the Gallery to engage present and future generations around modern art.”

                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  The Schools Standard ICT Operating Environment (SSOE) was started in 2009 by the Singapore Ministry of Education (MOE) to consolidate the provisioning and management of desktops, network and ICT support for MOE schools in Singapore. SSOE 2, which was awarded to NCS in March 2017, was the second iteration of the project, building on the successful model of the original while updating it with newer technologies and innovations. Provisioning and managing networks, devices and support across a country’s schools is a complex and ever-changing endeavour. To adapt to the evolving education needs, MOE commissioned NCS to upgrade its SSOE capabilities and services. 
In SSOE 2, new products and features such as 2-in-1 notebooks were introduced, together with better and wider wireless coverage and more robust security. The new notebooks had touchscreen capabilities that enabled them to be used like a tablet with handwriting recognition capabilities. The aim was to untether the notebook from the desk, giving teachers more freedom to focus on pedagogy and not be restricted to the front of the classroom. NCS redesigned the Procurement Portal which allowed schools to order ICT products and services from multiple vendors by making it as intuitive as an online shopping site. This made the procurement process easier for users. NCS also introduced a Innovation Programme where we explored innovations to enhance the user experience in the schools’ environment.  Another major innovation that was introduced with SSOE 2 was the automation of delivery of the SSOE 2 systems to schools where the deployment of school infrastructure (servers and virtual machines) reduced the turnaround from 4 days to 1 day. This improved the efficiency of systems delivery enabled more schools to transition to SSOE 2 much more quickly and benefit from its new features and capabilities. 
The transition consisted of a pilot phase, which was followed by mass deployment to all schools.  To support teaching and learning needs, NCS supplied schools with more than 3,000 virtual servers and storage. On top of that, we set up 24/7 Data Centres equipped with more than 1,000 virtual servers, network, storage and security appliances. We also provided ongoing support that covers Service Desk, Portal Operations, Managed Services (for Infra operations), and Enterprise Security Solutions so that SSOE 2 users have access to comprehensive and secure IT support services.  Whilst NCS continued to innovate on the technology front to ensure that things were done fast and done right, there was also a lot of coordination work involved to ensure that the transition to SSOE 2 went smoothly. For example, the introduction of 2-in-1 notebooks - which were meant to be light notebooks that could be carried around easily for use anywhere - initially met with challenges, with feedback that the screens were too hot, USB ports were insufficient and issues with detachable keyboard. In response to the feedback, NCS made modifications to the notebook settings to mitigate the hot screen issue and worked with MOE to introduce USB hubs with more ports. In addition, the NCS Change Management team worked with MOE to familiarise teachers with the use of the new devices and leveraged different communication and support strategies such as user journeys, graphical emails and quick guides to educate teachers on the changes and minimise disruption. 
  The SSOE 2 rollout brought MOE’s ICT infrastructure to the next level to better support teaching and learning needs linking more than 100,000 devices across 344 schools. During the Covid-19 pandemic, NCS also had a close collaboration and partnership with MOE ITD to assist teachers and students with Home-based Learning. From a cost perspective, the deployment of future-proof technologies such as virtualisation, Gigabit networks and a hyper-converged architecture has helped to reduce the server footprint, improve network performance and hosting overheads for MOE. Overall, initiatives under SSOE 2 resulted in a more cost-efficient infrastructure and useful services that enable schools to leverage ICT more effectively for teaching and learning. In 2022, MOE announced that the SSOE 2 programme would be extended by 3 years and with NCS as its partner, schools can continue reaping the benefits of the SSOE 2 programme.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  As a government body with H.E.A.R.T. at the centre of its service mission, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) of Singapore envisioned its contact centre to be more customer-centric. H.E.A.R.T. is a set of service principles - Hear them out, Make it Easy, Anticipate their needs, Respect every individual, Be Timely – that underpins MOM’s customer experience programme and business objectives. To meet the evolving needs and expectations of its stakeholders and callers, the Ministry embarked on a contact centre transformation to help its call agents better manage calls and customer feedback. The MOM Contact Centre handles all incoming calls and various other forms of contact from the public. The transformation of the contact centre involved improving internal processes and implementing digital technologies such as advanced analytics, robotic process automation, voice recognition technology and performance dashboards. Incoming voice calls to the centre are managed by an Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) where the users can perform self-help or request for agent assistance. As part of the contact centre transformation, extensive data collection technologies and analytics were implemented across multiple systems, enabling MOM to better able to track caller behaviour and understand their needs. Robotic Process Automation was introduced to help contact centre agents with user account management. The technology automates the creation of user accounts and helps assign the relevant privileges. A Whole-of-Centre Performance Dashboard was also created for the contact centre’s call and email agents. The customised dashboard allows managers and team leaders to track overall performance while agents can track their own work performance throughout the day. At the same time, voice recognition technology was implemented to facilitate customer feedback surveys. At the end of a call, a customer could respond to the survey by using a voice command. The use of advanced analytics has enabled the contact centre to segment its caller base more accurately. Relevant information can now be streamlined and delivered to callers via the personalised IVRS even before they speak with an agent. Where suitable, callers can also be directed to more efficient service channels such as a self-help menu. Robotic Process Automation has also helped improve operational efficiency in the contact centre by eliminating most of the manual steps involved in account creation and shortening the time taken by up to 75%. The introduction of other capabilities such as user feedback tracking, IVR analytics and performance analytics also enables MOM to establish a service quality framework and system to ensure continuous improvement and service excellence. As MOM continues to deliver even greater customer experiences, NCS is working with the ministry to apply design thinking to generate new ideas for process improvements and operational advanced responsiveness. Using NCS’ DRIVE Design Thinking approach, we are exploring new solutions that can be implemented to solve problems, better equip call agents, automate processes and build a call centre infrastructure that is future-ready.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  The inspection and maintenance of tyres are non-negotiable. Nonetheless, it is a tedious and labour-intensive task, especially for large fleets. NCS joined forces with a multinational tyre manufacturer to provide three cloud-based IoT platforms that offer real-time monitoring and management, reducing labour intensity, unnecessary breakdowns, fuel consumption, and emissions. Monitoring, inspecting and maintaining tyres takes time away from letting tyres do what they do best - be on the road. However, not ensuring that they are in the best condition can lead to devastating outcomes. Existing Tyre Pressure Monitoring Systems (TPMS) have also been deemed unreliable and too expensive. NCS leveraged Microsoft Azure to create Tirematics, Toolbox, and BASys for Bridgestone.   is a new TPMS that allows real-time tyre-monitoring through embedded sensors and powerful cloud-based stream analytics.   empowers field personnel worldwide with a fleet customer management system capable of conducting inspections and performance monitoring.   centralises and streamlines the retreading process to increase convenience and sustainable practices. NCS’ end-to-end management of these systems has achieved high cost-savings and helped validate Bridgestone as   sustainable mobility solutions provider. Tirematics significantly reduced costly tyre-related roadside breakdowns and lowered fuel consumption. Toolbox's compatibility with mobile devices allows the provision of higher-quality customer services. BASys’ efficient retreading tracker allows Bridgestone to reduce greenhouse gases emitted in the production and consumption of raw materials year-on-year.

                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  Hostplus, managing 1.8 million members’ retirement savings, sought to enhance its mobile app for a seamless, secure, and user-friendly experience. NCS Australia modernised the app, transitioning from Xamarin to native platforms, improving performance, security, and accessibility. The redesign enabled secure access to account information, balances, and investments, with automated testing ensuring minimal crash rates. Faster load times and enhanced security drove a 94% year-on-year increase in app usage, a three-fold increase in positive sentiment across reviews and social media, and a 4.5-star rating on the Apple App Store. 
    
  Enhancing the user experience to deliver better outcomes for members was a primary driver of the project. Hostplus’ young demographic made the need to enhance the user experience particularly acute and drove demand for a more fit-for-purpose digital offering. However, the solution also needed to provide for the requirements of retirees. Compounding the challenge was Hostplus’ reliance on legacy technology, stifling the ability to innovate or deliver at speed. 
 
The project and outcomes needed to represent value for members. Hostplus understood a usual application baseline for success would not be enough. Highly responsive, low crash rates, accessible, and fast would be the foundation and not the pinnacle. They needed a seamless migration from the old app to the new – with Hostplus committed to no members being logged out during the upgrade – while linking design and branding so members would intuitively know how to use it. All of this was no small feat, particularly factoring in the ‘security first’ mindset Hostplus bring to every aspect of their development and release lifecycle. 
  The work focused on incorporating intuitive and accessible design, with flexible architecture in transitioning from an outdated Xamarin mobile framework to using native application platforms. Ensuring high performance and first-class security were embedded, with ongoing improvements in speed possible, was also important. 
 
User experience and application security was at the core of every development and design decision, with the team focused on leveraging technical best practices to ensure a secure, extensible, scalable, high-quality app, with experience design applied to create an engaging user experience focused on education and improving member outcomes. Accessibility was a critical aspect in the design of the app, ensuring that all members can navigate and use the app with ease. The result is an enhanced user experience, which will not only have a positive impact for Australians living with a disability, but all users of the app, with improved design, layout and flow. Finally, cross-channel consistency enhances the app, ensuring the strong Hostplus brand is presented across both digital and non-digital channels, which is key to building trust, maintaining brand integrity and ensuring member confidence in every interaction. 
 
Delivery was achieved within six months and on budget, creating a strong foundation for the addition of expanded features in the future. 
  The redesigned app offers secure access to account information, balances and investment options with ease, and meets the diverse needs of its members. An intuitive interface, with a focus on education, allows for easy account management for members at any life stage. The app’s inclusive design has been a key factor in its success, ensuring it resonates with a wide demographic. Automated testing resulted in a 0.02% crash rate on iOS and a 0.07% crash rate on Android. Seamless integration, faster loading times and enhanced security have delivered 94% growth in app access year-on-year, more than three times greater sentiment – based on reviews and mentions on social – and a 4.5 Apple star rating. Hostplus has also seen engagement rise, with the median number of logins per member increasing by 30% when comparing the three months pre-and post-launch. A strong working relationship between the teams has been vital to its success, with the app recognised as a Gold winner in the 2025 World Design Awards, 2025 Australian Design Awards and 2024 Melbourne Design Awards in the Digital – Finance category.

                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  Phishing scams have become one of the most pressing cybersecurity challenges, with losses in Singapore reaching a staggering $1.1 billion in 2024 . As phishing tactics continue to evolve, traditional detection methods are proving insufficient. These outdated approaches often fail to accurately assess whether a website is legitimate, leading to delayed responses and increased risk. Recognising this urgent need, the NUS-NCS Lab developed an advanced phishing validation solution that uses deep learning and AI-driven multi-layered content analysis to determine the legitimacy of websites with greater precision and efficiency. Phishing attacks have become increasingly sophisticated, making it harder to accurately validate a website’s authenticity. The rise of encrypted web traffic and the use of generative AI allow phishing websites to bypass conventional detection. Many no longer rely on obvious tactics like copying logos, instead using subtle and deceptive branding that slips past standard filters. This growing complexity demands a smarter, faster validation approach—one that goes beyond traditional blacklists and manual checks. The core challenge is ensuring high validation accuracy while reducing manual workload and response times. The solution is built on a combination of visual annotation and object-label detection, enabling it to assess whether a website genuinely belongs to the organisation it claims to represent. By analysing domain name consistency, targeted brand phishing intent, and content structure, the system significantly improves validation precision. Unlike conventional models that rely heavily on human intervention, this approach automates the validation process, reducing human effort by 85% and enabling the rapid processing of up to 100,000 suspicious URLs daily. This latest advancement incorporates generative AI to automate validation, enhance detection accuracy, and strengthen security. It also ensures that phishing scams are flagged more swiftly, preventing potential financial and data losses. By developing cutting-edge phishing validation technologies, the NUS-NCS Lab, in collaboration with the NCS cybersecurity team, is leading the way in combating online scams. The solution has led to significant improvements in validation precision, dramatically reduced manual effort, and increased the speed of verifying suspicious websites. This innovation strengthens digital trust for businesses and individuals alike, ensuring they remain protected in a fast-moving threat landscape. It marks a major step forward in proactive cybersecurity and sets a new benchmark for website validation and resilience against phishing.  Source: The Straits Times Share this article on: Thank you for your enquiry!

             You can drop us a call or email Published:   - NCS today announced the creation of a new Enterprise Strategic Business Group (SBG) and the appointment of industry veteran, Mr Alfred Goh, as Managing Partner to lead the SBG with effect from 16 September 2022. Reporting to Mr Ng Kuo Pin, CEO of NCS, Goh will be responsible for bringing together NCS’ Healthcare, Transport, Financial, Industrial and Commercial client service units and service organisations like applications, and infrastructure to accelerate NCS’ growth momentum in the enterprise space. Most recently Goh was the Chief Executive Officer of DHL Supply Chain for Southeast Asia and before that, the President and Chief Executive Officer of DHL Supply Chain Japan and Korea. He brings with him 18 years of global and regional industry expertise in leading B2B enterprise growth, capturing emerging markets and expanding regional growth. Prior to this, Alfred was with Accenture advising public and private sector clients on large-scale Enterprise Resource Planning and Application Maintenance Services Outsourcing projects, as well as the roll-out of finance shared service centres in Asia Pacific. Commenting on the appointment,  , “I’m pleased to have Alfred on board to lead the charge for enterprise growth. He is joining us at a time when we are experiencing new growth and strong demand for technology expertise and solutions from both the enterprise and public sectors. His wealth of experience will strengthen the current leadership bench and advance our growth in the enterprise sector.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  From purchasing a car to scrapping it, the Vehicle Registration & Licensing System (VRLS) has got the lifecycle of vehicle management covered. Introduced by the Land Transport Authority (LTA) of Singapore in 2006, VRLS connects motor agents, government agencies and industry players such as insurance, hire purchase and financial institutions to provide a one-stop information and services hub for the motoring ecosystem. For land transport, the future goes beyond building roads or creating a well-connected transport network. It is about total transport management to ensure sustainability and the creation of positive travel experiences for public and private transport users. In line with this, NCS has been developing and maintaining systems that make it easier and more convenient for members of the public to interact or transact with government agencies on transport-related matters. Examples include the online Certificate of Entitlement Open Bidding System and the Vehicle Registration & Licensing System. The VRLS enables motorists and businesses to perform vehicle-related business transactions from the convenience of their homes and offices, using a secure e-commerce platform that incorporates electronic authentication and automated financial and compliance regulatory checks. With VRLS, a road tax renewal can be completed with a few clicks of the mouse instead of having to travel to LTA to queue up for counter service. Car owners will also have all their vehicle-related transactions displayed in a single view which they can access easily and conveniently over the Internet. The self-help capabilities of VRLS have benefited LTA as well, allowing it to re-deploy its counter staff to higher-value customer service roles. Built for scalability, VRLS allows new online technologies to be plugged easily into the system, facilitating enhancements and upgrades. Over the past few years, major enhancements to VRLS included the integration of the Vehicle Inspection and Type Approval System, the implementation of a traffic offences portal, the introduction of electronic day licences and proactive notification of payments due.    This article was first published in NCS SG50 Book “Technology Evolution”, 2015 (NLB BRN:201353230) Share this article on: Discover how you can chart your career and elevate your skills.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  – NCS today announced the pilot launch of  , an innovative transport app targeted at drivers to bring them greater convenience and better driving experiences. The multi-functional Breeze app integrates disparate and multiple sets of data and adopts Artificial Intelligence (AI) and video analytics to provide real-time hyper-localised information that enables drivers to find the nearest available parking, check for the best parking rates, see Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) price changes and get vicinity information such as local eats, point of interest and walking trails. The six-month   pilot follows the successful beta release of the Breeze app on mobile application stores in April this year. A community initiative by NCS in collaboration with Tiong Bahru Community Centre and Tiong Bahru Market Hawkers’ Association, the app has been enhanced and hyper-localised with additional features and content to encourage the discovery of the Tiong Bahru precinct and promote walking explorations with custom maps of points of interest and other features. Tiong Bahru is a popular estate with a thriving community of visitors, residents, and businesses. The pilot aims to ease traffic flow by facilitating information for drivers on parking availability and pricing and by extension, encourage park and walk options so visitors can explore more places in this vibrant estate. During the pilot programme, the NCS development team will also work with retailers, residents and visitors in Tiong Bahru to gather user-generated content and feedback on Breeze to further improve the parking and walking experiences of the precinct. , Minister in the Prime Minister’s Office, Second Minister for Finance and National Development and Adviser to Tanjong Pagar GRC Grassroots Organisations, said, “I am excited to see how this public-private partnership and the use of leading technologies can help improve the experience for drivers in the neighbourhood and make it even more attractive. This pilot project in Tiong Bahru with NCS can also pave the way for other uses, such as promoting heritage trials in the area, or even be used in other neighbourhoods.”  said, “Through our strong collaboration with the government and community associations, NCS is reimagining innovative digital solutions for the community at Tiong Bahru. The Breeze app leverages NCS’ deep experience in the land transport sector and our digital innovation capabilities to improve visitor experiences and highlight urban liveability of neighbourhoods.” NCS has been engaging 800 private vehicle drivers to better understand their needs and priorities to design an improved driving experience into the app. Focused on simplifying parking decisions and bringing convenience to drivers, Breeze provides real-time insights on the availability of parking lots and enables drivers to easily view and compare parking rates of nearby carparks. To capture crucial traffic information, NCS’ digital and engineering teams designed a non-invasive and innovative video analytics solution – the Breeze Box – placed at the entry and exit points of Seng Poh Lane carpark and Tiong Poh Road. The carpark’s parking availability information is then pushed to drivers via the Breeze app, even before they start the drive. Breeze incorporates the first “AI local-accented” navigation guide and can provide drivers the fastest or cheapest routes as traffic conditions and ERP prices change. It also offers real-time views of traffic across all highways and checkpoints, thereby helping drivers make informed decisions about their travel routes. Breeze features custom maps of local points of interest, the Tiong Bahru heritage zone, a hiking trail, and local eats such as Roz Pho’s, Lennard Yeong’s East and West Makan Picks and Durians Everywhere. Event-specific and special zone maps, such as school zones, are also available, including the recent Singapore Night Festival and Mid-Autumn Festival. The hyper-localised content about Tiong Bahru will help promote local businesses and improve visitor experiences. To kickstart the pilot, NCS organised a driving and walking experience around the Tiong Bahru precinct using the app with invited guests. Breeze can be downloaded from the   and  .

             You can drop us a call or email Published:   – The Singapore National Eye Centre (SNEC) has partnered with NCS to design, build, and deploy a new Appointment Scheduling Optimiser (ASO) to transform clinic operations, reduce patient waiting times and allocate manpower and resources more efficiently. The ASO taps on NCS NEXT’s capabilities in artificial intelligence (AI), advanced analytics, and machine learning technology on patient and operational data to perform optimal supply-demand matching, thus ensuring patient appointments are matched optimally with available clinical resources. The ASO is scheduled for rollout in the fourth quarter of 2021 and is planned for further scaling and deployment across all SingHealth institutions to improve overall clinic operational efficiency, elevating patient satisfaction and experience. Annually, SNEC manages a workload of 360,000 patient visits in its Specialist Outpatient Clinics.  said, “Currently, appointment scheduling for all patient visits including those requiring initial consultations and the necessary same-day eye services and investigations is a time and labour-intensive process handled by appointment staff. To address the growing volume of appointment requests and limited visibility over demand at multiple service stations resulting in bottlenecks and long clinic waiting times, SNEC collaborated with NCS to leverage the Appointment Scheduling Optimiser to resolve the various pain points.” NCS will deploy advanced data and predictive analytics as well as machine learning to tailor an in-house schedule optimisation ASO platform. Using SNEC data sets with exact patient and operational requirements, AI algorithms perform supply-demand matching and appointment schedule optimisation is done continuously and incrementally with minimal human intervention, until an optimal daily schedule is reached, matching confirmed patient appointments with all available clinical resources.  said, “We are delighted with this opportunity to work with SNEC to play a critical role in the digitalisation of healthcare services that will have a tangible impact on the end-to-end patient journey. The first-of-its-kind in Singapore, the Appointment Scheduling Optimiser marks the first of many use cases in healthcare, such as the improved allocation of hospital beds, operating theatres, and even optimising valuable nurse-to-patient staffing for better care. The Appointment Scheduling Optimiser is an example of how digitalisation of business operations can revolutionise customer outcomes.” The ASO operates on NCS’ proprietary Enterprise Schedule Optimisation Platform which offers the opportunity to scale the capabilities of the smart scheduling solution, offering businesses in a range of industries beyond the healthcare sector greater flexibility to customise solutions to better suit their needs. The ASO will leverage data analytics to better predict future resourcing demand, enhance optimisation and improve long-term resource allocation as well as operational efficiency.

Pixels (sometimes referred to as web beacons or clear GIFs) are small electronic tags with a unique identifier that are sometimes embedded in websites, apps, online ads and/or electronic communications.  This technology provides usage information like ad impressions (how many times an ad is viewed) or clicks and is used to measure performance of online services and associated advertising, and to access information from user cookies. Most websites, apps or online products or services make use of these technologies, because they improve your online experience.  We may use, and allow third parties to use, cookies to collect information to help us operate our websites, apps and other online products or services more efficiently and effectively, and to provide better or more relevant products, services, content and advertising to you.

             You can drop us a call or email Andre Conti | Chief Operating Officer for Enterprise  Posted on Oct 15, 2020 One may assume Andre Conti is French, due to his fluent French, but Andre was actually born in Luxembourg, though his family has its roots in Italy. A true global citizen, Andre has a breadth of experience spanning across 12 European countries, before making Australia home 14 years ago. Prior to joining NCS in 2020, he has accumulated over 30 years of invaluable experience in the information technology sphere, with a focus on cloud computing. With his extensive experience, Andre is the ideal candidate to helm the growth of NCS NEXT Solutions in Australia and to accelerate cloud transformation in the region. As the Lead of NEXT Solutions in NCS Australia, he relishes the opportunity and challenge to develop the Australian practice from the ground up with a diverse and capable team. One area of the business he will be focusing his efforts on would be the growth and delivery of cloud solutions to support his clients’ cloud transformation efforts. On his mission to establish a footprint for NCS in Australia, Andre will need a strong team to meet market demands for cloud computing, the modern workplace, big data analytics, and cybersecurity. Building a strong team that can deliver a best-in-class experience for clients requires perseverance and grit. Andre is no stranger to these traits. As a seasoned long-distance runner, he clearly understands that business is very much like a race. In order to run a successful race, a runner has to embody the values of consistency, far-sightedness, focus, and endurance. Andre looks forward to creating lasting long-term value and demonstrating the benefits of embarking on the cloud journey with NCS. Andre has his sight on assembling a team with deep expertise so as to address market demands. He foresees his team being able to marry their vast experience along with expertise in the cloud computing sphere to create a long-term success formula of value creation for our clients. With about 30 staff under his wing now, Andre aspires to beef up the manpower to five times its current strength in the next two years. Assembling a dream team he can call his family, he intends to nurture his team carefully to bring out the best in each member, and together build a cohesive and resilient unit. Living by 3 golden values, he keeps to these: authenticity, honesty, and open-mindedness. Andre believes in providing value to people by framing solutions, in a constructive, tactful way that appeals to the client’s needs and concerns. For clients, this translates to an authentic relationship built on a foundation of trust, with their interest in mind.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:   – Leading technology services firm NCS has launched a suite of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and digital resilience (DR) solutions for organisations looking to re-invent themselves in the AI era. These include frameworks, solutions and accelerators that governments and enterprises in Asia Pacific (APAC) can easily tap to use AI securely and at scale to drive sustainable game-changing innovation. The launch took place at its annual Impact forum today where NCS CEO, Ng Kuo Pin, addressed over 1,000 leaders and technology practitioners from the region, and shared NCS’ AI-led plans for changing the game. He highlighted two key success factors for organisations – AI adoption and digital resilience – to fully harness the benefits of technology in a world redefined by economic uncertainty, geopolitical tensions and technological challenges.  said, “Across the world, AI is top of mind now, but organisations must not overlook the importance of digital resilience as they embrace AI’s transformational potential. To build a safer and more sustainable future, it is crucial that organisations invest to build a foundation in cybersecurity, data governance and technology that will allow AI to flourish. We believe organisations that master both AI and digital resilience will be the ones that will thrive in this increasingly complex global environment.” NCS’ new suite of solutions include the  which enables organisations to build a strategic roadmap that enhances both AI and digital resilience concurrently. Serving as an essential starting point for any organisation embarking on its AI journey, the innovative framework categorises organisations into four quadrants of AI Dust, Missed Opportunity, House of Cards, and Game Changer (see Figure 1), based on their maturity levels of AI adoption and digital resilience. This allows organisations to assess their AI and digital resilience readiness and calibrate key developmental steps as they move down the AI pathway. , “AI will be a game changer and companies must learn the new game – the earlier, the better. Given the speed at which AI evolves and the implications of AI for businesses, working with the right technology partners to help navigate the AI landscape and plug into the right ecosystem is fundamental. Having primed our workforce for the intelligence revolution, NCS is AI-ready and well-positioned to help organisations avoid the pitfalls of AI adoption while unlocking its game-changing value. We will lead with AI inside and outside.” NCS also introduced  , a solution for organisations to assess their digital resilience across five key areas –  . Leveraging NCS’ expertise in large-scale implementations and operations, Polaris DR will enable them to lay the strong foundation needed for enterprise-wide growth and AI adoption by providing a customised improvement plan to address vulnerabilities in systems, technology infrastructure and IT operations. To empower clients to deploy AI more securely and efficiently, NCS announced five innovative and repeatable  embedded with NCS AI Accelerators. The solutions are both standardised and customisable, enabling organisations to accelerate AI deployments in three key areas –  – while ensuring consistency and scalability. The solutions not only leverage NCS’ track record in partnering governments and enterprises on their technology journeys, it also taps NCS’ deep industry knowledge and methodologies honed over time, regional AI talent pool, and extensive partnerships with global players in AI technology. NCS announced several strategic partnerships with industry leaders to further facilitate AI adoption and digital resilience. NCS is partnering   to launch its   with AWS’s Generative AI Innovation Centre (GAIIC) . Customised for the APAC public sector, the CoE will leverage AWS’s team of strategists, applied scientists, engineers, and solutions architects through the GAIIC’s Partner Innovation Alliance programme to envision, scope, and accelerate public sector solutions using AWS. The collaboration combines NCS’ end-to-end capabilities and industry experience with AWS’s Generative AI services and global expertise.  “We’re excited to collaborate with NCS to establish its inaugural CoE for Public Good that will accelerate the delivery of innovative citizen services. At AWS, we help customers move Generative AI from theory into practice by providing purpose-built services and expert guidance. Through this collaboration, we’ll empower NCS to bring Generative AI workloads to life and help public sector agencies drive impactful outcomes for the people they serve.” NCS is collaborating with  to leverage Dell AI Factory with NVIDIA, as an to further accelerate adoption of Generative AI solutions by enterprises in the region. With their combined expertise in Generative AI and breadth of industry experience, NCS and Dell are committed to simplifying clients’ AI adoption journeys and enhancing proof of concept efforts.

NCS also signed an MOU with  the global leader in the digital transformation of energy management and automation, as   to provide clients end-to-end sustainability offerings and AI-enabled solutions. The partnership additionally leverages the deep expertise of both companies to better address higher density computing demands from Generative AI workloads and meet emissions compliance requirements, through innovations in sustainable and energy-efficient cooling systems for GPUs and CPUs. Clients will also benefit from a holistic suite of green offerings including education, consulting, solutions and services, tailored to better reduce their carbon footprints and progress towards Singapore Green Plan 2030 and Net Zero. , “Our partnership with NCS represents a critical step towards setting a new standard in sustainability for data centres. The urgency to decarbonise the energy-intensive data centre sector cannot be overstated, even as Singapore and the rest of the world double down on cutting down greenhouse gas emissions from our operations. By leveraging our respective expertise, we aim to enable clients to achieve new operational efficiencies, reduce their data centre carbon footprints, and realise significant energy cost savings.” NCS is collaborating with   to extend location-based, hourly travel insurance for travellers in Singapore through the innovative  mobile app. With this new offering, Breeze users will soon be able to receive location-based recommendations for  that offer pay-per-hour travel insurance for short trips when travelling to nearby countries. Additionally, Income’s motor insurance policy holders can use Breeze to access    . The partnership lays the foundation for the future use of data and AI to enhance insurance services, such as providing supplementary data for accidents using mobile device sensor analytics. , “We are constantly looking to work with like-minded partners in closing protection gaps. Through this collaboration with NCS, we are able to leverage smart, real-time data to extend insurance protection to motorists and travellers. With valuable insights and data via Breeze, we can better co-create customer-centric insurance innovations to meet modern lifestyle needs.” As NCS becomes intelligence-led, the company has been infusing AI across the organisation and building a pipeline of future AI talent.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  In the opening phase of the AI era, marked by geopolitical volatility, business uncertainty, and increasing technology complexity, organisations must navigate constant change. At the NCS Impact Keynote 2024, we discussed how a winning combination of AI and digital resilience could change the game for sustainable growth and innovation. With significant investments and rapid AI adoption across Asia Pacific, the region is strategically focused on leveraging AI to drive economic growth and innovation. As AI-powered systems become more pervasive, organisations must adopt a balanced approach to AI development. This means harnessing the innovative potential of AI technologies, as well as ensuring their integration within robust digital frameworks. Building resilient AI systems requires ongoing investments in cybersecurity, ethical AI practices, and adaptive capabilities to mitigate risks and respond to emerging threats. This holistic approach will enable businesses to unlock new value, enhance decision-making, and drive sustainable growth while safeguarding against potential vulnerabilities and ethical pitfalls. The “AI-Digital Resilience Matrix” framework offers a practical lens to develop and communicate a strategic roadmap for enhancing both dimensions currently. This framework categorises industries, organisations or use cases into four distinct quadrants based on the extent of AI adoption and digital resilience levels, as seen in the table below. How can you change the game to future-proof your organisation with sustainable growth and innovation? Learn how the “AI-Digital Resilience Matrix” framework can help your organisation and also view the full keynote summary.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  - Singtel today signed agreements with Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (NTU Singapore) and the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) to spearhead R&D efforts in emerging technologies that will support Singapore’s transformation into Smart Nation and help enable the country’s digital economy. Under a five-year partnership, Singtel, NTU Singapore and the National Research Foundation Singapore (NRF Singapore) will establish a S$42.4 million corporate lab, to be called Singtel Cognitive and Artificial Intelligence Lab for Enterprises (SCALE@NTU), to develop applications for use in the areas of public safety, smart urban solutions, transportation, healthcare and manufacturing. The partners, through their collective expertise and resources, aim to accelerate innovation in the fields of AI, advanced data analytics, robotics and smart computing. Mr Bill Chang, Chief Executive Officer, Group Enterprise at Singtel, said, “This collaboration marks a significant step for Singtel to develop intellectual property in emerging technologies to support enterprises in their digital transformation and Singapore’s Smart Nation objectives. As businesses face the rising threat of technological disruptions, companies are constantly seeking innovative ways to gain deeper insights through data analytics, better engage their customers and transform their operations through digitalisation. To help companies address these challenges, we are stepping up our R&D efforts to develop deep capabilities in these focused areas.” The research by SCALE@NTU aims to resolve various challenges faced by cities in keeping their infrastructure facilities in tip top running condition. With the use of smart sensors embedded with AI, city governments can analyse data from infrastructure facilities and can decide to conduct maintenance works only when necessary to achieve optimal performance for these assets. This would help cut operating costs for cities that currently spend significant amounts on routine maintenance, whilst not compromising on infrastructure quality and performance standards. Professor Lam Khin Yong, NTU’s Acting Provost, Chief of Staff and Vice President (Research) said, “For Singapore to achieve its Smart Nation vision, we have to keep pushing the frontiers of AI and develop innovative ways to process, analyse and utilise big data. This is how the collaborative effort between Singtel and NTU on cognitive computing will make a huge impact, improving productivity for businesses while making our cities smarter and more efficient.” Over the next five years, this partnership is expected to expand the product range of Singtel and its regional ICT subsidiary NCS. Some 100 researchers from Singtel and NTU will work at SCALE@NTU, while another 200 research engineers, graduate and undergraduate students will also be trained in the lab. The collaboration builds on NTU’s strong expertise in AI and data science, with the university ranked world No. 2 by Nikkei and Elsevier for having the most-cited research papers in these areas. Mr George Loh, NRF Singapore’s Director (Programmes), said, “This latest collaboration between Singtel and NTU underscores the significance of developing research expertise and capabilities in advanced analytics for Singapore to be a leading provider of smart city solutions. The lab will provide a platform for researchers and engineers from both academia and industry to work together to translate cutting-edge research into digital solutions and offerings by our companies, while nurturing a pipeline of digital talent who can drive Singapore’s Smart Nation journey.” Singtel and A*STAR will also work together on projects including smart building automation systems, robotics and Internet of Things (IoT) applications that could help boost operating efficiencies in various industries. Robots can be deployed to handle biohazardous waste, allowing companies to deploy their employees to undertake higher value-added jobs. Such technologies can be tested on Singtel’s NarrowBand-IoT and 5G mobile network in a model factory to be set up by A*STAR next year. Professor Tan Sze Wee, Executive Director of the Science and Engineering Research Council at A*STAR, said, “Public-private partnerships and open innovation pave the way for successful projects that could benefit the Singapore economy and lives of Singaporeans. In this age where disruptions are emerging rapidly, such joint collaborations are all the more valuable. A*STAR is happy to partner with Singtel to drive R&D in the latest technologies towards applications across industries.” Share this article on: Explore our end-to-end ICT solutions that shape various industries through technology.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  A public service agency was facing performance issues with its collaboration management system. Resources such as CPU and storage were running at maximum capacity, with ageing and unreliable hardware and software hosted in a traditional on-premises data centre. To improve performance and reliability and ensure scalability for future expansion without heavy new capital investments, the agency decided to migrate the workload to Amazon Web Services (AWS) to take advantage of the on-demand capabilities of the cloud. The NCS customer is a public service agency which had a collaboration management system running on ageing hardware and software hosted in an on-premise data centre. The agency was facing challenges with its public service collaboration management system due to the limited capacity of the existing configuration. During the original set-up, upfront investments were made in hardware and software, which became a limitation as they became obsolete over time, causing performance issues. And it was not possible to scale and expand the system to meet the public sector’s growing collaboration needs without heavy investments in new infrastructure and manpower. The agency decided that a more viable solution would be to move the collaboration management system to the cloud, paving the way for better collaboration and future expansion. NCS worked closely with the agency to move the system to Amazon Web Services (AWS), based on the AWS Well-Architected™ framework which describes the key concepts, design principles, and architectural best practices for designing and running workloads in the cloud. This would help to ensure operational excellence, security, reliability, performance efficiency and cost optimisation. A robust migration plan was developed and executed to move the public service collaboration management system to AWS. Best practices were also put in place to manage the system’s backend infrastructure on the AWS cloud.   With the workload on AWS, the agency is able to harness resources on-demand with a pay-as-you-go model. This eliminated the need for large capital investments on hardware refresh or new purchases. By right-sizing their infrastructure, the agency can now improve utilisation by starting small and scaling when necessary. It also significantly reduces the total cost of ownership compared with the traditional hosting model as the agency need not own and invest in hardware, software as well as licences upfront. The ability to provision resources on-demand also enables the organisation to respond quickly to changing business requirements whilst maintaining better control over the budget. Timely patches and security updates on AWS ensure that the organisation is better protected against cyber security attacks and any risk of non-compliance with regulatory requirements. This allows the agency to use the system with peace of mind. AWS is a proven platform with three Availability Zones (AZs) in Singapore and many more in different geographic regions around the world. This provides the assurance of high availability and disaster recovery with minimal additional investment. With the system now hosted on AWS, the agency is able to scale the workload to meet future needs with minimal incremental investment. Additional capabilities such as disaster recovery can also be easily integrated by tapping into the AWS infrastructure should the need arise.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  Singtel, Asia's leading communications technology group with over 675 million mobile customers around the world, needed to replace the ageing electronic mobile top-up system that was supporting its pre-paid business. It decided to deploy a next-generation system using the Amdocs Electronic Top-Up Platform running on Amazon Web Services. By applying agile methodologies, the NCS team was able to deploy the solution quickly and offer new value-added services whilst taking advantage of the cloud to deliver cost savings, high availability, and automated system back-ups One of Singtel’s key consumer offerings is its prepaid services portfolio which encompasses voice calls, data plans, SMS, IDD and roaming. An important revenue stream for this segment is the recharging or top-up of prepaid accounts. It is therefore important for Singtel to offer quick and easy ways for its customers to top up their prepaid accounts, whether through its agent distribution chain or through self-service online payment using a mobile app. Supporting this is the Electronic Mobile Top-Up (EMTU) system which enables Singtel pre-paid customers to top up their cards through any of these channels. However, the legacy hardware appliance-based EMTU system was out of warranty which meant that support was limited. There was no availability assurance, nor were there any disaster recovery measures in place should the system fail. This was a matter of concern, given the direct impact the system had on revenue generation. Singtel decided to migrate to a next-generation electronic mobile top-up system built on Amazon Web Services (AWS) to take advantage of the scalability, high availability and reliability of the cloud infrastructure and ensure business continuity. Called the Universal Mobile Top-Up (UMTU), the software-defined system was developed using the Amdocs Electronic Top-Up Platform. It comprised the Amdocs MFS core, a transaction engine running core financial and non-financial transactions; a digital finance portal which provides a web frontend for viewing and performing transactions; a database layer for managing system states, including stored value wallets; and an integration layer that allows for connectivity to third-party solutions through a standard set of application programming interfaces. The architecture developed by the NCS cloud team enables new functionalities and value-added services to be integrated easily into the system. For example, electronic top up capabilities can be combined with airtime distribution, allowing Singtel agents and distribution channels to complete the entire transaction through a variety of channels such as mobile and the web. New user features can be added, such as providing more payment options and giving subscribers access to detailed transaction statements. The system also paves the way for Singtel to partner other companies providing billing systems, value added services, service aggregation and short message service centre (SMSC) gateways to expand its scope of services. To secure access to the system, the NCS team deployed an enterprise-wide AWS Landing Zone catering to multiple user profiles with segregated permissions. For example, top-up vendors could access the system via the Internet to update their transactions, while audit personnel could connect via the intranet to examine security log files Using agile methodologies, the NCS cloud team was able to develop and deploy UMTU within seven months. Furthermore, NCS also manages the day-to-day operations of the system, powered by its next-generation of Cloud Managed Services. These managed services are underpinned by Artificial Intelligence Operations (AIOps) and Artificial Intelligence Security (AISecOps). These two services are powered by an underlying machine learning platform that monitors real time and historical data to perform anomaly detection, performance analysis, and correlation and contextualisation. This intelligence helps UMTU to reduce unplanned downtimes through pro-active interventions. When incidents do occur, task automation allows UMTU to quickly respond to incidents – reducing actual business downtime.   With the cloud-based approach, the new UMTU system is able to deliver significant cost savings compared with the on-premises system. Using the consumption model, non-production environments can be turned off after business hours, delivering savings both in terms of ongoing operating costs as well as the total cost of ownership. The next-generation NCS Cloud Managed Services have further reduced costs through automation and AI. By running the system on AWS, the NCS team made sure that the UMTU server infrastructure can be scaled easily to support business growth whilst delivering high availability to meet the service level agreement requirement of 99.99%. The new EMTU solution is prepped for disaster recovery with automatic backups in the cloud ensuring that the system can be easily restored in the unlikely event of failure. Security has also been strengthened with modernised controls, tools and processes. For example, the principle of least privileges ensures that users are given the minimum level of access needed to execute their tasks. The system also incorporates security tools such as Amazon CloudWatch, Amazon GuardDuty, and the AWS Certificate Manager which is used to provision, manage, and deploy public and private certificates for use with AWS and internal connected resources. By giving customers a choice of different channels to top up their prepaid cards, the system helps increase convenience and enhance the user experience. For those looking to recharge their cards at a physical store, location services within the UMTU app also helps them to find the nearest distribution agent. The system captures aggregated non-personal customer data to help Singtel analyse customer behaviour and provides insights to improve customer service and engagement.   Share this article on: Discover how you can chart your career and elevate your skills.

                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  Change is the new normal, and with a rapidly advancing digital landscape, application modernisation is a reality that we cannot escape from. Global research consultancy firm Gartner defines application modernisation as the migration of legacy IT systems to new applications or platforms, including the integration of new functionality to align more closely with business needs.  "Organisations today are looking to achieve three main goals from application modernisation: improving operation efficiency, engaging customers better and growing revenue,” said Ms Tay Siow Yen, Head of NEXT Solutions, NCS. But application modernisation is not as simple as moving existing apps to the cloud—also known as the “lift-and-shift” approach. “The kind of assets that can be moved to the cloud will vary across organisations, depending on the nature of the business and the risk appetite of those involved,” she said. Security is often cited as an area of concern for organisations that are contemplating cloud adoption. In the case of investment banks, for instance, on-premise servers are more suitable for storing sensitive information such as investment data, Ms Tay said. But with the current advancements in cloud technology, storing the assets in-house may not necessarily be safer than putting them on the cloud, she noted. “Cloud vendors are prioritising security in their services, especially since it directly impacts consumer trust and brand reputation. They want to prove to companies that going cloud is actually safer than staying at home,” Ms Tay said. “Moreover, building in-house security parameters is a costly operation. Not every organisation can afford the expensive security cost or even find suitable talent to do so.” In the past, when companies needed to create tools for their operations, they had to build their own capabilities using bespoke and purpose-built apps. But now, these capabilities are easily available as API functions or value-added services by the ecosystem of maturing cloud providers, said Ms Tay, who cited the example of a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) with human resource (HR) functionality. 
 
“Emerging areas of technology such as data analytics and artificial intelligence are increasingly being used in HR processes. Individual companies may not have the resources to continuously invest in these advanced HR tools and may lose out to competitors leveraging SaaS,” she pointed out.  Before organisations embark on a cloud journey, there are difficult questions that they have to think through before they can even start defining their strategy, Ms Tay said.  First and foremost, they have to review the company’s portfolio and risk appetite to determine how aggressively the company can move to the cloud. For this reason, Ms Tay emphasised that there is no one-size-fits-all cloud strategy that can meet the needs of every company. “It really depends on the nature of the business, the critical assets of the organisation and the business strategy on the whole,” she said.  
 
Working through the personalisation process, as difficult as it may be, is necessary because a lift-and-shift approach to cloud adoption will only deliver limited results, Ms Tay cautioned. “The optimal scenario would be for the company to leverage cloud-native capabilities for their digital transformation. Processes such as automation—using DevOps and adopting emerging tools and features—will enable them to reap the maximum benefits of cloud.”  
 
Alongside the benefits, there are also certain drawbacks to moving to the cloud. Inevitably, moving to a cloud platform entails losing a certain degree of visibility and control. For instance, the system downtime will depend on the service provider, and there is a possibility it could occur at an inconvenient time, Ms Tay shared. 
 
Change management is, therefore, a difficult issue to grapple with when an organisation adopts the cloud. “The technical aspect can be pretty straightforward because vendors will take care of it for you. But generally, people tend to be resistant to changes and to losing control, so this mindset is not easy to overcome,” Ms Tay said.  
 
Management mandate and support are therefore crucial on this journey, she said, because cloud processes and changes could cut across traditional departmental borders and may even require completely different skillsets to execute.  One way to address the challenge of change management is to break down the technology adoption process into phases, Ms Tay suggested. This is as opposed to using a Big Bang approach, in which all users associated with a particular system migrate to a new one en masse at a specific point in time. Using NCS’ CODE-X model as an example, Ms Tay described how NCS takes customers through a design thinking workshop where they co-create solutions with their customers for their problem statements and pain points. The ideas are then put to test using proof of concepts (POCs), where test runs of the applications are carried out on CODE-X, a safe environment with various toolsets made available. Only when the POCs are successful are the apps rolled out into production. 
 
Highlighting the advantages of co-development, Ms Tay explained that breaking down adoption processes into POCs allows customers to experience how things work in bite-sized pieces. Customers also come to understand how the new tools can enhance their workflow, and learn how to identify and address challenges at an earlier stage.

NCS to Launch Cloud Centre of Excellence: The Fast, Advanced Path to Cloud Computing for Australian Businesses | NCS SG  to launch cloud centre of excellence: cloud computing for   businesses Contact Us Thank you for your interest. “During the lockdowns and border closures, we saw more businesses using the cloud to scale their services rapidly to varying levels of supply and demand, adapt to consumer needs as they shift online and support remote working.” Cloud computing remains at the heart of digital transformation for Australian businesses for a number of reasons. ​​​​​​​Existing obstacles to adopting cloud services NCS to launch cloud centre of excellence from Australia Rapid transformation for rapid change See how NCS Australia can get you onto the fast, advanced path to cloud transformation explore more

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  The cloud continues to take businesses in Australia by storm. By the end of this year, 80 percent of Australian enterprises will shift to cloud-centric infrastructures and applications twice as fast as before the pandemic. In 2020, Australian spending on public cloud services topped approximately AU$6.7 billion, the second highest in the Asia Pacific (APAC) region[1]. In states like Victoria, around half of businesses are using paid cloud computing software[2]. The Victorian government is also spending roughly AU$3 billion every year on ICT, with a growing focus on cloud solutions[3].  Many local companies hold large storehouses of legacy data, workloads and applications that are not properly formatted for the cloud and challenging to migrate. If not performed correctly, migrations can lead to downtime, disrupting services and causing financial losses.  Australian businesses seek a mix of public, private and on-premises environments that suits their business needs and to avoid vendor lock-in. Multi-cloud environments require experienced setup, continuous monitoring and breadth of resources linked to different clouds. These tasks are overwhelming for in-house IT teams, which are already bogged down with business IT projects.  Companies struggle to build their internal cloud teams as there are not enough local cloud computing professionals.   [4]. To help businesses accelerate complex cloud transformations, leading ICT provider NCS is building a NCS Cloud Centre of Excellence (NCS Cloud CoE), which will offer experienced talent from across APAC. The centre will be launched in Victoria, which has the highest number of software development and cloud computing professionals on a per capita basis among Australia’s states [5]. NCS Cloud CoE will offload responsibilities of managing hybrid clouds from businesses, allowing them to focus on creating better services, reaching new customers and streamlining operations. The centre will also help expedite innovation. “Businesses don’t migrate to the cloud for the sake of it. They want to transform and offer new services and experiences to their customers,” said Chris Fleischmann, APAC Cloud Centre of Excellence Lead for NCS. “NCS Cloud CoE teams will comprise of experts in advanced technologies like AI and 5G from Australia and the region. They are well-equipped to help companies build innovative software and applications that meet future business needs.”   Not all cloud journeys are the same and NCS Cloud CoE experts have the experience to deliver complex, high-touch projects. For instance, companies that deal with confidential information, such as FSIs and insurance firms, need to comply with privacy and data sovereignty regulations. NCS Cloud CoE experts can help migrate highly regulated data and workloads into a hybrid cloud, drawing from their wealth of experience in dealing with similar issues in the government industry that they have supported for 40 years. NCS Australia is aiming to create 1,500 jobs in Australia by June 2022, 70 percent of which will be based in Victoria. The upcoming NCS Cloud CoE in Australia will be a milestone in the digital transformation of the state of Victoria and the country. The centre will help accelerate Australia’s innovative potential, contribute to the growing digital economy and improve workforce skills.

We conducted in-depth analysis, implemented an all-in-one cloud-based management application to bridge the urban-rural divide and digital infrastructure. The Smart Village App enabled the introduction of new services that are tailored to villagers’ needs, such as farm-to-table supply, and tracing services of its agricultural products. The implementation of the App pave the way for the economic revitalisation and sustainable development of rural areas. The local authority wants to adopt digital agriculture. However, they needed to establish an efficient connectivity network, digital infrastructure, data models and a robust management system to integrate the villagers into the industrial chain. The all-in-one cloud-based Smart Village App introduces new services tailored to the villagers’ needs. It also unified the village’s public services, enhanced administration & security management systems as well as the speed of communication through the improved connectivity and accessibility to new channels.

                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  
 
Wesley Kok, Gov+ Client Service Lead, Education, tells GovInsider how NCS is partnering stakeholders to shape a more collaborative and engaging educational landscape, where the classrooms of the future will offer more immersive learning experiences. 
 
The education landscape is shifting as schools are transitioning from books and encyclopaedias to the technology-fuelled classrooms of today and tomorrow, which offer more immersive learning experiences.  According to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the advent of information and communication technologies, or ICTs, has provided inclusive access to resources and information, developed digital competencies, and enhanced both learning and teaching in the digital age.  ICT plays a pivotal role in enhancing student performance by enabling collaborative learning experiences. However, as the digital landscape evolves, so do the risks and challenges associated with it.   NCS, a strategic solutions provider in the education sector in Singapore, is driving innovation and collaboration to transform the classrooms of tomorrow. By harnessing the power of technology, NCS is creating immersive learning environments that go beyond traditional boundaries.  Wesley Kok, Gov+ Client Service Lead, Education, for NCS tells GovInsider how the IT services provider is a trusted partner to education stakeholders, with a commitment to continuous improvement to shape the educational landscape and make its future more collaborative and engaging for all.  “Back in the day, we had books that allowed us to imagine outer space,” says Kok. “But what if you could immerse yourself on another planet, maybe even ride on the Mars rover?”  
 
One of the challenges for schools, educators, and their technology partners, he adds, is how to bring to bear such responsive and experiential learning environments.  
 
In Singapore, one of the outcome goals stated in the Ministry of Education’s (MOE)  , with the theme of “ ”, is for schools to provide digitally connected learning spaces that support anytime, anywhere learning.  
 
With a focus on integration, data-driven insights, and human-centred approaches, NCS aims to facilitate such “anytime, anywhere” learning and foster collaborative experiences for students and educators alike by staying at the forefront of emerging technologies.   
 
“Our solutions bring to life the immersive teaching and learning experiences. This includes the smooth delivery of ICT services in schools with minimal disruption and platforms that promote open virtual collaboration and secure communications,” Kok says.  
 
These solutions include productivity and communications platforms that leverage on the flexibility and speed of cloud technologies, he adds.  
 
“The future is where physical and virtual collaboration and learning becomes seamless and provides an environment where learners can learn at their own pace.”  According to Kok, NCS has been a partner of MOE since the early 2000s, supporting an early incarnation of the  (SSOE).  
 
This partnership has evolved over the years to support the dynamic education landscape and enable Singapore to maintain a leadership position in the global education space.  
 
“We might have good infrastructure [in education] here, but it’s not just about that. We have to keep on challenging ourselves on the newer technologies out there, and not just maintain the status quo and rest on our laurels,” Kok says.  
 
“NCS’s role as MOE’s strategic partner is to harness technology to enable this change. We believe an adaptive and modular meta-platform is required to allow rapid testing and learning and be able to switch on and off these capabilities.”  
 
He adds that immersive learning technologies such as the metaverse will become commonplace, giving learners access to rich experiential content that would be otherwise physically out of reach.  
 
“Collaboration in the future is no longer limited to person to person, between teachers and students.   
 
“There will be person-to-bot collaborations, harnessing Generative AI technology to further expand on the learning experience, helping both learners and teachers formulate better learning pathways,” he says.  One potential stumbling block to change, including the tech-powered changes that are just around the corner, is the need to shift mindsets.  
 
“It can be very hard to reimagine the teaching and learning experiences,” says Kok. “The good news is, we’re already quite advanced in [embracing new technologies]. Next is how we shift out of our comfort zone, the structured learning that we’re very used to, to [remain] competitive academically.”  
 
“We need to be comfortable to be uncomfortable.”  
 
A key underlying building block of the classroom of tomorrow is integration and data, Kok adds. This would allow better insights into the learners’ journey, help administrators understand “hotspots” in a teacher’s workload and allows them to take action to improve processes and experiences.  
 
Data would also enable educators to better assess how students are learning, such that teachers can then curate and tailor more dynamic, engaging and individually suited learning experiences.   
 
“More time can be spent to really understand how learners learn, the pace of learning and tailoring to this,” says Kok. “Integral to this will be data.”  With the availability and advancement of technology at such a quick pace, it may seem appealing to introduce multiple new technologies all at once, warns Kok.  
 
“We need to be aware of the limits of change for teachers and learners, given the wide spectrum of digital literacy,” he says, adding that its human-centred approach serves NCS well when it comes to introducing change.   
 
“Having clarity of purpose and timing when new technologies are introduced is critical.”  
 
Many of these technologies are new and would require guardrails, such as the use of Generative AI technology bots. Kok also highlights the importance of a “ ” to secure data, endpoint, and cloud workloads.  
 
“There will be heightened data and cyber security risks especially as we gather more data relating to learners and personalised learning data, and many of these technologies are based in the cloud.” Share this article on: Thank you for your enquiry! We'll get back to you as soon we can.

                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Dorothy Oskar | Applications Services  Posted on Jan 13, 2021 Dorothy Oskar’s journey in the technology industry started early in her life when she was recruited by the National Computer Board (NCB) right out of her computer science studies in Australia. Excited by the opportunities to learn new processes in various domains, Dorothy has been a part of the NCS team ever since. Dorothy now serves as Head of Business Application Unit, NCS. She played a large role in the Singapore government's push towards civil service digitalisation by harnessing technology to improve public service’s operation and customer service efficiency. She recounts her experience in designing and implementing systems in law enforcement to prevent white-collar crime as well as developing HR and payments systems for the civil service as some of her works that saw through her growth. Having worked on multiple government projects, Dorothy finds deep satisfaction in having helped the public sector in Singapore, seeing how it has been recognised for keeping pace with technology, and she wants to do more. Dorothy believes that while she can continue to contribute at a strategic level, she wants to plan for long-term continuity and impart her experience and knowledge by investing in her team. She believes people development is the way forward and actively coaches up-and-coming talent enthusiastically. For Dorothy, every situation is an opportunity to develop her team, even in the most demanding projects. She wants her team to grow their skill sets, develop mental fortitude, while keeping an open mind to learn and overcome hurdles. This is important as organisations face the harsh demands of market forces and challenging timelines. The next generation of leaders needs to have fortitude and enthusiasm to take on challenging projects and outperform their toughest critics, and Dorothy is nurturing these future leaders with a sense of vision to continue the NCS legacy. Accomplishing this would be another milestone in her role as a leader.   Just as she invests time and effort in her teams at work, Dorothy puts the same energy into the children's choir in her church, which she teaches on the weekends, making sure the choir has the right technique and pitch. Music has always been in her life. Whether she is behind the piano or in front of a choir, Dorothy wants to always keep learning. Her latest challenge for herself is to learn jazz improvisation, something different from the classical pieces she has always been more familiar with. As life throws inevitable curve balls, the ability to improvise according to the situation and seize opportunities can make all the difference. Staying open to new opportunities and different approaches help Dorothy and her teams avoid becoming fixated by any one technology or solution, and this adaptability helps keep them relevant.

This system increases convenience for members of the public to interact or transact with government agencies on transport-related matters. Florence attributes her career growth to the guidance from many good mentors who have passed on their invaluable skills and deep knowledge. Amongst some of the important skills she picked up include soft skills to improve her people management and in handling difficult customers. One tip she shared was to build a personal relationship based on mutual understanding with the client to enable smoother discussions. She values speaking genuinely and straightforwardly to clients. This way, she can emphathise with her customers, understand their challenges and find the appropriate solutions to solve their problems. Florence's leadership style is in listening to people's needs and trying her best to accommodate them. She also empowers her team to makes use of their different strengths to complement one another. Her penchant for fixing things like spoiled radios has Florence took on the field of computer science during her uni days. Outside of work, Florence is an active sportsperson, always loving ball games such as badminton and netball with her friends. In fact, her leadership skills were honed during secondary school where she represented her school in badminton as the team captain. And she feels pride in her work when she manages to deliver solutions to customers satisfactorily. To Florence, team efforts are what contributes to the success of smooth delivery and customers' compliments are incentives that motivate her teams to do even better. Florence's personal values centred around care, kindness and respect. She strives to "pay attention to others, and not take people for granted", making every moment with each person count. In her view, the world will be a better place with a caring culture where people regularly check in on each other and when words like "please" and "thank you" are often used to express appreciation and gratitude.

             You can drop us a call or email Ong Keng Wah | Practice Lead, Project Leadership, Applications Service  Posted on Apr 19, 2021 To prepare for a four-day hike in Nepal, Ong Keng Wah spent three months building up his stamina. He took long walks around Macritchie Reservoir, climbed assiduously up and down Bukit Timah Hill and chalked up thousands of steps. “I had to prepare myself mentally and physically,” he recalled. “City people like us like to take the escalator and the lift, but the route that we were going on is known to have a lot of climbing steps, so I had to get used to the distance, and this couldn’t be done overnight; it had to be built up progressively.” It was just like managing a project. “You start off doing smaller projects to build up your experience. And when client has faith in you, you will have the opportunity to take on bigger challenges.” Keng Wah is Practice Lead for Project Leadership at NCS Business Application Services, overseeing pre-sales and delivery for clients in Public Sector, Defence and Homeland Security. He is also the Application Managed Services Lead for Service Leadership, managing application system maintenance and operations. And he sees many similarities between this world and the experience of trudging up mountains. During a hike, companionship and teamwork are important. “You need people to encourage you, a good coach and guide to motivate you to take small steps and achieve little goals along the way, until you finally complete the journey.” In project management, good teamwork is also key to successful delivery. As Keng Wah pointed out, “Our business is primarily driven by people. Project managers have to be sensitive to what the team is going through and help the members to understand one another.” “When things do not run well, there is no point saying you have a lousy team, or that the people are not functioning well, or HR is not giving you enough resources. If a team cannot deliver, you have to find out what it is that motivates the members and fix it.” In his view, a good team has to be a hybrid of different kinds of people. “If you have a team where everybody is a visionary, who will be there to do the delivery? You need to get the right combination so that the team members will complement each other.” This may mean having some people who are very detailed in their work, some who are good at coming up with ideas, some with strong domain knowledge or technical skills, and some who may be good in leadership. “As leaders, we are defined by the teams that we form,” he said. Project management journeys can be painful at times, especially if the delivery is rough, he acknowledged. He has worked on large transition projects where NCS took over from another vendor, and had to build up technical knowledge of the system from scratch, understand what the incumbent was doing, read up the documentation and pick up the day-to-day operations and processes by shadowing and reverse shadowing the incumbent and client. “Sometimes, the project delivery can get rough,” he said. “It is hard work but as you press on, you realise that you can actually do it.” During the Nepal trip, Keng Wah was climbing about few thousand steps a day, setting out at 8am and finishing only at about 6pm. The going was tough, and there were moments when he wondered what he was doing there. “But when you finally complete the trip, the view is breathtaking,” he said. “So don’t give up. When you finally achieve your goal, all the hard work is worth it.” Share this article on: Discover how you can chart your career and elevate your skills.

             You can drop us a call or email Lim Lan Geok | Vice President, Infrastructure, Public Sector  Posted on Jun 01, 2021 During her university days, Lan Geok majored in computer studies, having initially chosen to specialise in application development. After 2 years, she decided to apply for her true passion in enterprise infrastructure at National Computer Board which was set up in early 1980s as a public body to computerise the civil service in Singapore.   "I do not want to deal with applications; I want to deal with machines."  Contrary to the belief that men would usually work with machines, while women worked with applications, Lan Geok is against such a stereotype and is for the idea that: "Whatever work guys can do, girls can do it too." Along her journey with NCS, she took on roles involving service delivery and management of operations teams and has developed a keen understanding of both the hard and soft skills needed to manage her team and projects for success. Today, Lan Geok leads a team of more than 2000 employees as the Vice President of Infrastructure Services.   2010 was a significant milestone for both NCS and Lan Geok. The company won a mega project to set up the technical infrastructure for 360 schools in Singapore and provided technical support for teachers and students. Having played a key role in the tender process, Lan Geok prides herself for being part of a team that won the tender. Despite the many hurdles met during the tender process, Lan Geok’s never-say-die spirit and positive learning attitude helped pull her through the challenges and multiple late nights. She has since emerged stronger with bigger and bolder plans to grow the infrastructure services beyond the region.   Being a hands-on leader who is resourceful and skilled in identifying and isolating issues, Lan Geok sometimes finds herself on the ground with her teams in the wee hours to solve customer challenges. She says: "If the bulk of what you do is what you like, it's ok, because it energises you and makes you come to work every day."   Lan Geok attributes her astute leadership skills to her ex-mentors whose advice are still clearly etched in her mind. She is also eager to pass on these valuable lessons by sharing her experience with her colleagues, employees and friends. Lan Geok credits the people-oriented culture at NCS for allowing her to pursue her ambition and to develop her strengths and interests. She resonates in connecting the right jobs with the right people and creating the right fit to increase motivation, deliver results and increase employee retention. When met with uncertainty, she finds herself consulting her ex-mentors and she is appreciative of the precious bond she kept with them. In any case, Lan Geok finds it best to make decisions based on facts and data as "analysing them gives me insight."   As with many other working mothers, Lan Geok recognises the challenges in balancing work and family commitments and credits her success to her supportive family members. She regularly meets up with her siblings and goes on trips with them. She places much importance on her family’s wellbeing, constantly checking up on her siblings and never hesitating to lend them a helping hand when in need. The recent circuit breaker and alternate working schedule due to the pandemic have also allowed her to be able to spend more time with her daughter and husband, enabling her to better balance between work and family commitment.   Share this article on: Discover how you can chart your career and elevate your skills.

                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Yip Chun Kit | Practice Lead, Mobility  Posted on Aug 04, 2021 In the last few kilometers of a marathon, runners often find themselves pressing on in small groups, sharing the same pace and encouraging each other to go on, observes Chun Kit, a regular marathoner and Practice Lead for Mobility at NCS. “They may not have started with you, but they are the ones accompanying you at that stage of the journey. It is something that I never fail to draw inspiration from.” Chun Kit has taken part in 10 races in as many years, and he often draws parallels between those experiences and his life journey. Completing his first marathon was an inspirational experience, he recalls. “It was a triumph of mind over body. I did something that I never thought I could do, and that inspired me to do many things that I always wanted to but didn’t have the courage to try.” The same year that he completed his first marathon, Chun Kit mustered the courage to make a career switch from a quality assurance engineer in the commercial sector to a project manager in the government sector. Eight years later, that same courage spurred him to leave the government sector to join NCS. “By then, I was feeling a bit stagnant and complacent in a comfort zone. With passion for emerging technologies, I decided it was time to join a professional services company where I can challenge and upskill myself in terms of my technical competencies.” As Practice Lead for Mobility, Chun Kit strategises and leads the delivery of enterprise-grade mobile applications and platforms for NCS’ clients, which also involves working with them on digital transformation and application modernisation. Continuously growing the size and deepening technical competencies of the Mobility team is his top priority.  It is important for his team members to keep developing new skills to keep up with the latest trends in technology, he says. He gives the example of cross-platform mobile development, which enables businesses to quickly engineer and deploy their mobile assets on a variety of platforms without recoding for each native operating system (Android, iOS) and platform. He believes that this is an important skillset for his developers to pick up. “Either you know your enemy and conquer it, or be replaced by it,” he said. “There is still a technical position for native mobile app developers but we need to equip ourselves for the rise of new technologies such as cross-platform development and Progressive Web App (PWA). That explains why the Mobility team does more than just mobile app development now as we have upscaled and widened our competencies to deliver end-to-end application modernization for clients, covering mobile application services, platform management services and API (application programming interface) and microservices orchestration.” ‘We can’t learn swimming until we are in water’, he says. With strong support of NCS leaders, he provides his team with practical platforms such as client projects and proof-of-concepts to apply and deepen what they have learned. Digital transformation goes beyond just digitalising manual processes with technologies and requires an end-to-end mindset, a re-thinking of ways to meet client real needs. While his team has been helping clients to embark on a journey of digital transformation on various scales with tailored strategies, the core success factor is always the trust and respect between his team and clients. “Clients can tell if we are really putting their interest and needs as top priority. Blessed with my highly competent and professional Mobility team, we established strong rapport with our clients who respect and entrust us with their digital transformation. Clients have the confidence that we will only provide the most appropriate solutions. Expensive technologies don’t equal digital transformation”, he said. Chun Kit likens his team to the marathon pack he finds himself running with in a long-distance race. “As we run, we find more and more people coming together, running at the same pace, and it creates a positive energy that attracts more to join the group.” His team is getting bigger, and they are running at the same pace. “Delivering excellent services to our client is our goal. Internally, we need to pace ourselves, keep the momentum and build up the synergy to   to the goal.” Share this article on: Discover how you can chart your career and elevate your skills.

                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Mackay Goh | Practice Lead, C4i  Posted on Jul 26, 2021 The FA Cup Final in 1985 made a die-hard Manchester United (Man Utd) fan out of Mackay Goh.   The game was into extra time and the team was one man down when Norman Whiteside raced down the right and curled the ball into the net, edging Man Utd past defending champion Everton.   It was a thrilling, inspirational match. “That started it,” said Mackay, who began delving into the team’s history – the air crash of 1958 that decimated Man Utd, how manager Matt Busby rebuilt it, and how it went on to win the FA Cup within five years and the European Cup 10 years later. He has also watched the team play in Hangzhou, Guangzhou, Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, London and of course the holy grail at Old Trafford in Manchester.    The collective team work displayed in the match is what Mackay aims to have with his team and counterpart across the NCS family as the NCS Engineering Managed Services Lead (EMS Lead) for the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Public Sector. This is a new role that he is undertaking after he relinquished his role as Command, Control and Communications and Computer Intelligence (C4i) Practice Lead, a Practice that he has setup and grown over the years.  A graduate in Computer Engineering, Mackay began his career in DSTA serving MINDEF and MHA in Singapore before uprooting himself and work in China for the next 15 years, in the InfoComms space to build C4i platform for regional public safety agencies. In China Shenzhen, Mackay built up an software engineering centre from scratch to well over hundreds of engineers. Recalling the experience, he said, “The Chinese engineers were very hungry to acquire new skills. I enjoyed tremendously to coach them, and share good values that I felt were important.”  Besides coaching them in their day job, he would also run monthly workshops on wide range of topics from tennis to wine appreciation. And his reason was this: “The team need to learn and appreciate the culture and the people you are dealing with.”   “We were dealing with American and Asia-Pac clients and to make sure that the process is seamless, the engineers needed to understand the people on the other side of the table – what shapes their minds and their thoughts and how they work,” he said. “Once you know the people, you can resolve a lot of differences.”   Mackay brought back the valuable learnings he gleaned from his experiences abroad and this has underpinned his leadership style which has been particularly relevant in the context of NCS’ organisational transformation.   “As we moved towards a more client focused, and we need to have constant interaction between our teams as we engage with clients at different levels,” he said.   With these developments, he sees the organisational structure becoming more of a matrix where people come and contribute as teams instead of operating in silos. To enable this, the people will need to have the ability to transform. “We have to deepen their competencies and allow them to move around.”  One way of doing this is to give the workforce bite-sized training to equip them to handle new technology challenges. For example, employees could spend half an hour every day, or every week, watching clips on topics like agile and containerisation.   Continuous learning is important as his team helps clients to navigate the changes in the business technology landscape in order to achieve their business objectives.   In fact, this is something that fuels his passion for his job – the fact that things are constantly evolving.  For example, technology has been changing the way policing is done. C4i systems have helped to improve police response and provide a full picture of emergency situations with common situation awareness, AI-led response and sense-making.    Today, video and analytics have the potential to take things even further. “We have a lot of data from different sources - surveillance cameras on the road, social media, and coming soon drones. We are looking at how we can visualise all these data to make real-time decisions, so we can analyse threats and detect when people need help even before they call us.”  This dovetails with his aspirations for NCS to become a global IT and solution service provider that makes a difference by improving lives. C4i systems already do this by helping to save lives in emergency situations where every second counts, he pointed out. In recent years, he has seen more and more adoption for these systems beyond defense and public safety sector. For example, airports, ride hailing and man-guarding companies are using C4i systems to manage their business operations to ensure optimal business efficiency.  “Whatever technology we put in, every technology we put in, we do it to improve people’s lives,” he said.  After returning to Singapore a few years ago, his passion for the beautiful game – and an under-utilised brand new school field – spurred Mackay to start a football club in his alma mater, Poi Ching School with a couple of likeminded parents.   He coaches the kids on weekends, helping them to improve their motor skills and play outdoor, getting them to interact with their school mates, and teaching them how to win and lose as a team. His two sons, aged 9 and 12, join in the sessions too, “It’s a good father-and-child bonding activity,” he said.  Share this article on: Discover how you can chart your career and elevate your skills.

                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Reza Andradi | Client Delivery Lead – Aviation and Maritime  Posted on Feb 09, 2022 A mechanical engineer by training, Reza decided to take the plunge into IT consulting as he found his passion was in working directly with people to help transform their business. As a consultant, Reza focused on harnessing the power of IT in accelerating his clients’ digital transformation journeys. “I didn’t know too much about IT then,” he said candidly. “But as I worked on using IT to transform my clients’ business, I picked it up along the way, project by project.” With 20 years of amassed experience in enterprise resource planning systems, Reza desired a new role that would give him greater breath of exposure in terms of transport client industries and the technologies he could offer to them. NCS, with its focus on end-to-end digital transformation, provided him with that opportunity. In May 2021, Reza joined NCS as Client Delivery Lead for Aviation and Maritime Transport. In this role, he works with clients to ensure smooth project delivery and value realization. He also works alongside the sales team to explore strategic business opportunities. In Reza’s view, one of the unique things about NCS is its positioning as a homegrown company. Clients see NCS as “part of the Singaporean family” whom they can place their trust in. And it is very important for NCS to reciprocate this trust by delivering on its commitments to them, he said. To do this well, he has to build up effective project teams with strong capabilities to support clients’ requirements and help them achieve their business goals. This requires Reza to know his team members well in order to place them in the right roles. “It is important to know their strengths and weaknesses, their work experience and areas of expertise, to ensure that the role that is assigned to them is suitable to their background and career aspirations and will allow them to grow and learn new things,” he said. When it comes to leading teams, Reza likes to set objectives and encourages team members to find ways to achieve those goals rather than dictating the way they should work. “It is important to articulate expectations openly and candidly while being approachable in providing support for every project team member,” he said. “I need to know when to support them from the back and lead them from the front,” he said. “I have to trust the team member to take the initiative and support them when they are having difficulties.” Building personal relationships and trust is also important when it comes to working with partners and clients. “We must be open, consistent, and maintain fairness and integrity when dealing with partners and clients,” he said. “We must consistently deliver to our commitments, and likewise demand that partners and clients deliver to their commitments.” As a Client Delivery Lead, he feels that one measure of success is when a client continues to be a friend even after the project is over, and is happy to be a reference. “That is when I know I have done the job well and delivered value to the client,” he said. Outside of work, Reza likes to listen to all kinds of music - from classical and new age to jazz and heavy metal, from Indonesian and Chinese to English and Spanish songs, from 60s-era music to current pop favourites. He appreciates music for its universality and timelessness. He also loves travelling. Having studied in the United States, he has travelled to 40 of its 52 states including Alaska and Hawaii, and has Tibet, Africa and South America on his bucket list. Recently, he has been exploring nature within Singapore. On weekends, he sets out to discover new hiking routes with his wife. With the couple starting out early to try to catch the sunrise, their two children – a daughter in her first year of Junior College and a son in Secondary 3 – prefer to opt out and sleep in instead. A recent trail that they tried was the T15 from Mandai to Bukit Panjang. They have also done the Coast-to-Coast Trail, covering the 10 stations over three days. But their favourite is the hike from Dairy Farm Nature Park to Bukit Timah Hill. Besides spending time with the family, Reza also takes a step back and try to strategise what he needs to do next in his work. “During the work week, my focus is on work. On weekends, I try to reset,” he said. “In that sense, I am always recalibrating on a weekly basis, across different areas. That helps me to achieve the right balance for a more sustainable lifestyle.” Share this article on: Discover how you can chart your career and elevate your skills.

             You can drop us a call or email Wong Lai Quen | Client Delivery Lead, Healthcare  Posted on Mar 24, 2022 A strong believer in the spirit of teamwork and leading by example, Lai Quen leads by working through the trenches with her team. As Client Delivery Lead for Healthcare at NCS, she insists on taking a hands-on approach when it comes to working with other delivery leads and project managers to ensure that projects are completed successfully, meet the projects financials and with high customer satisfaction. “Whenever there are delivery issues or challenges, I will work with the project managers and delivery leads to try and resolve the problem,” she said. “For example, in a service organisation, resource is always a challenge, so we need to make sure that our project managers are well supported in terms of talent and the required capacity.” Lai Quen is no stranger to service delivery. Prior to joining NCS in 2018, she had accumulated a wealth of over 30 years of global business services experience. In her current role at NCS, Lai Quen sees it as her duty to reach out to her team members when they encounter difficulties and try to identify the right expertise to help them. She also guides the team when they come across contractual challenges. She recounted an incident whereby a customer had asked for the price of a service contract to be reduced by 20 to 30 percent, even after the NCS team had gone through a few rounds of negotiations. “The customer would not budge”, said Lai Quen, “And I knew that if we don’t solve this issue, we weren’t going to close the deal”. She examined the contract and past service records to show the customer examples of where high system availability requirements could be adjusted without undermining the organisation’s business requirements. The customer eventually agreed to the adjusted targets. “In order to effectively close a contract, each party needs to benefit in some way,” she said, “In this situation, I will rationalise with the customer so that we can reach a good settlement point between us and the customer.” Another aspect of Lai Quen’s work is to look at project financials and help the teams to grow their accounts. “We need to raise awareness that delivery is not just about delivering or managing to the contract. A good project manager, needs to improve the contracted project sold margin and needs to actually grow the contract,” she said. “A delivery lead or project manager is often the best person to do sales, especially in services. Customers have seen them deliver, and have a lot of trust and confidence in them.” She is proud of the fact that all her project managers and delivery leads have been able to improve the margins of their contract and to grow their contracts. In the past two to three years, NCS Healthcare has grown exponentially, and while the sales and sector leads played a major part in the sales activities, the project managers and delivery leads also contributed a lot to the effort. For Lai Quen, her work in healthcare resonates on a personal level as well. At home, she takes care of her husband, who has been diagnosed with young onset dementia which requires a lot of medical care and attention.  At home, the couple regularly play boardgames like Scrabble – one of her husband’s strong suits during his younger days - which Lai Quen sees as a good way for him to continue working on the things he can do and stimulating his brain. She also makes it a point to get him to take part in other activities, enrolling him in day care activities designed for dementia patients and joining him in advocacy programmes to share their experiences with others. Besides her husband, Lai Quen also cares for his mother who is bedridden. Her experience has led to a renewed appreciation of the various subsidy programmes that the Singapore government has introduced for its citizens, such as Pioneer Generation and CHAS, both of which have benefitted her mother-in-law. This is also where her professional and personal life connect. At NCS, Lai Quen is very much involved in the systems that support some of these subsidy programmes, and she has no plans to give up working despite her heavy caregiver responsibilities. “Through my work, I find that I am serving myself and my family.  Working keeps my brain active and providing some time for respite” she said.

Tan Wan Choon | NCS SG At the forefront of the change journey Contact Us Thank you for your interest. explore more 
                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Tan Wan Choon | Head, People & Culture, NCS  Posted on May 12, 2022 You need to have a genuine passion for the profession and the drive to “make things better”. As Head, People and Culture (P&C), Global Delivery at NCS, Wan Choon has an exciting job scope ranging from providing HR consulting and advisory to business leaders in the organisation as well as partnering them on the full spectrum of employee lifecycle from manpower planning, performance management, career development and progression, employee engagement, etc to overseeing restructuring processes that could affect thousands of people in the company. One significant restructuring exercise was the integration of the then EDMS (now known as Infrastructure) from Singtel into NCS, to realign EDMS capabilities to NCS. The restructuring, which took place in November 2019, meant that about two-thirds of the 4,000-strong team at EDMS had to be re-deployed to NCS, and the P&C team played a key role in the entire process. More recently, NCS has conducted further restructuring exercises involving the integration of Trustwave teams into NCS in April 2021 and 2022 respectively. The pre-integration period was “particularly critical” as it involved conducting the due diligence needed to ensure the successful amalgamation of teams. “We have to find out which roles would be affected and the required competencies for the various positions as well as identify any potential callouts,” Wan Choon said, “This was necessary in order to map out an effective organisational structure.” P&C team also had to come up with clear and effective messaging to be cascaded from business leaders to their teams. Different communication channels were employed – from townhalls where teams were given a heads-up as to what was going to happen and why; to small group sessions addressing questions from colleagues within the same team; and even one-to-one engagements where specific colleagues may require more information. The timing of information release also had to be executed back-to-back to prevent any gaps in communication. she said, “The last thing you want is for people to distort or second guess the story and worry unnecessarily.” Throughout the integration process, P&C team had to be mindful of the emotional well-being of affected colleagues. “Some people were worried about losing their jobs so we had to assure them that the company will leave no man behind,” she said, “There were also some who had forged a strong bond with their colleagues over the years and were saddened at the prospect of having to transfer teams.” P&C also played a role in harmonising the dynamics of the new teams, helping to foster rapport among new teammates and supporting the newly appointed leaders in managing and engendering trust within their team. “After things settled down, we had to routinely check in with team leaders and members to find out how everyone was coping, whether they faced any issues and if there was anything, they wanted us to look into,” she said. “If the needs arose, a focus group can be set up so that they could raise their concerns.” The key to ensuring a smooth integration is planning, change management and communication. “You really need to plan in detail and run through it again and again,” she said. “You need to go through the planning regardless of the scale and you cannot miss any of the steps. You also need to ensure precise execution of the communications plan, manage emotions and sentiments and help build trust in the new teams and leaders.” As a P&C professional, she acknowledges that “managing people is never easy”. “Even with the same issue, the reaction you get from two different people will be very different. But you need to do what is right, and you must have the courage to do it.” One of the greatest satisfactions that Wan Choon gets from her job is to be able to solve issues that colleagues come to her with. And that also takes passion. P&C professionals need to like what they do, whether it is responding to employee concerns or figuring out more effective ways of doing things and “challenging the possibilities”, she said. In order to help others, they also need to take care of themselves to ensure that they can deal with the pressures of their work. For Wan Choon, her two “four-legged daughters” – a golden retriever and a miniature schnauzer – play a big role in helping to take away her stress after a long day at work. “They are authentic, innocent and will always give you their unconditional love. Spending time with them is very relaxing and a form of self-care to avoid burning out,” she said. “And it is only with a well-rested mind that we will be able to find the patience to solve other people’s problems.” Share this article on: Discover how you can chart your career and elevate your skills.

             You can drop us a call or email Ang Kian Seng | Senior Director, Growth Programs, Telco+  Posted on Jun 09, 2022 This quote, and  a Japanese philosophy of continuous improvement, is a practice that have guided Kian Seng’s approach towards his various roles undertaken over 20 years in the IT industry.  Today, the concept of kaizen, is even more relevant with increasing pace of change in the world of IT. The opportunities to learn new ways of doing things better, is what attracted him to take up his current role as Senior Director for Growth Programmes in NCS’ Telco+, a joint initiative between Singtel and NCS to help telcos drive their digital transformation initiatives.  Telco+ is a strategic business group focused on scaling NCS’ business in the telecom sector, and Kian Seng is responsible for driving the growth initiatives to achieve this goal. “With Telco+, our team’s mandate is to break ground in new markets, while continue to expand on the good groundwork present in both Singtel and Optus. This means we must be creative in ways we work towards outcomes, establish new relationships, identify new areas where we can present a compelling value proposition to our clients. To quote our team motto, "To do different things, and do things differently” said Kian Seng.  “Breaking new ground can be challenging at times, but it is also exciting, as you are always finding solutions to the problems you are encountering. What motivates me is working with a strong and dedicated team where everyone is committed to a common cause. This is critical to help everyone stay on course when going gets tough.” Kian Seng tries to identify a new area to get himself competent in every year, as part of his commitment to the kaizen philosophy. One of the most recent fields that he has taken up is coaching, where he seeks to help individuals to find their own answers by listening and asking the right questions. He believes that the best answer for one is through self-discovery. The ability to leverage on the different strengths of team members is important to drive strong performance together. Kian Seng hopes to use the coaching skills he has learnt to help his team realize their full potential and empower them to make the best decisions for themselves. Kian Seng also uses a journaling app on his phone to pen down his thoughts at the end of each day. “I try to make time each day to reflect what went well, and the things I can do better” he said. “I hope through this will help me to make small incremental steps in improving myself continuously.” Reflecting on his first six months at Telco+, Kian Seng acknowledges the numerous opportunities for learning. “It has been fun so far and I enjoy learning new things every day, working with different people in the team, gaining different perspectives. The opportunities to keep learning and improving is what makes IT industry so interesting and working with like-minded people in the Telco+ team is what makes it an exciting place to work in”.

Sophie Teo | NCS SG Setting her sights 8,849 metres high Contact Us Thank you for your interest. explore more 
                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Sophie Teo | Partnership Manager, Partnership & Alliances, NCS  Posted on Jun 16, 2022 In March this year, Sophie Teo climbed Mera Peak in Nepal. At 6,476 metres, it was the highest summit she had ever scaled. But she has set her sights higher. Much higher. For Sophie, Mount Everest is the ultimate goal. A nature lover, Sophie’s passion for mountain climbing began back in 2010 when she made her first successful ascent to the peak of Mount Yotei during a trip to Hokkaido, Japan. Back then, however, the heavy workload of her job made pursuing this interest impossible. As senior service manager with a global technology company, she was practically working round-the-clock. After a few years, she decided to take a break from her career. “The day after I left my job, I hopped on a plane to climb Mont Blanc”, she recalled. However, the lack of training was evident, and she was not able to summit. She had to settle for Le Petit Mont Blanc – a smaller, less strenuous climb – and went on to backpack around Europe for 1.5 months, visiting multiple destinations including Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Belgium, France, Italy, Hungary and Czech Republic. When she returned to Singapore, Sophie started working on her fitness and made good progress. After close to two-year break, the adventurer also decided it was time to get back to corporate life. In 2016, Sophie joined NCS as a Senior Solutions Architect and is currently a Partnerships and Alliances Manager where she oversees the building of strategic relationships between NCS and its business partners. Sophie likens her role in the company to that of a building contractor. “In a construction job, the contractor is the one that coordinates the required works including the plumbing, wiring and carpentry needed to complete the renovation,” she said, “At NCS, we bring together different skillsets in order to come up with a complete end-to-end solution for the client.” Among the common challenges Sophie has to navigate in this role is the fact that “the interests of both parties are not always aligned”. In these instances, it is her responsibility to find creative ways to bridge the gap so that a deal can be closed successfully. When it comes to dealing with partners, one of the main things that Sophie has learnt is to always understand their needs. “I start by telling them my objectives and they will also share what they hope to achieve, so that we can find middle ground. If their goal is to find leads to generate opportunities, then it is on me to ensure that they speak to the right people in order to make that happen,” she said, “If the partner is happy, they will be more willing to do business with us.” With her adventurous spirit and desire to co-create with clients, she exemplifies the spirit of adventure that NCS believes in. The thing Sophie appreciates most about her job is the flexibility when it comes to working with partners. “There is no standard protocol involved. The basic principle is simply to be honest and upfront with each other so that the work can be done quickly without any hidden agenda,” she said. While she is dedicated to her career, it is clear that Sophie’s love for mountain climbing remains. Preparing for a climb is no mean feat. She works out seven days a week, doing different forms of training. Her regime includes high intensity training for cardio, resistance training to build up her strength, and a lot of staircase climbing – walking up and down the stairs with a heavy load – to train the leg muscles. Endurance training is also important because climbers generally have to walk long distances during an expedition – sometimes 12 or more hours at a stretch. “It is mind over body,” she said. In the second half of this year, the climbing enthusiast has made plans to climb Nepal’s Mount Manaslu. With an elevation of 8,163 metres, this trip will give her a “good gauge of how my body reacts and help decide whether I should do another climb before Everest”. Despite the physical intensity and high costs associated with pursuing the sport, Sophie believes it is all worth it at the end of the day. “If I have only this sum of money and I can choose one category to spend it on, it will be experience,” she said. “Every mountain has its own unique features which is what makes the challenge and experience different. The people you travel with are also different. The magnificent nature view and environment are different and unique too. And these differences are what makes the activity so enjoyable,” she said.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:   - As part of Prudential’s customer-centric approach, the life insurer has launched an industry-first chatbot that can provide its Financial Consultants with real-time information specific to their customers’ life insurance plans. Named askPRU, the cognitive-powered chatbot is built on IBM Watson technology and integrated into Prudential’s backend systems. It is able to retrieve instantly data such as a customer’s policy cash value, policy premium due date and status of submitted claims, among others. As askPRU operates round the clock, Prudential’s Financial Consultants can communicate with the chatbot via a mobile application at any time of the day to obtain information pertaining to their customers’ insurance plans, enabling them to be more productive and more responsive. Using IBM Watson’s Conversation Service, askPRU has been trained by NCS’ data scientists1 to understand non-scripted questions, probe users to get to the intent of their queries and deliver responses in a way that simulates human conversations. Since the pilot launch of askPRU in July, more than half of Prudential’s 4,000 Financial Consultants have started to use the chatbot. Ms. Theresa Nai, Chief Operating Officer at Prudential Singapore, said, askPRU is part of Prudential’s commitment to continuously improve the service experience for its customers. “In today’s fast-paced, time-starved environment, our customers do not have the patience to wait for information. With askPRU, our Financial Consultants can now get faster access to customer-specific information and respond to their customers’ queries even more promptly. askPRU is one of the ways in which we digitally enable our Financial Consultants so they are equipped to meet increasing consumer demands and expectations,” said Ms Nai. askPRU complements PRUONE Express, an enhanced digital point-of-sales portal, to help Prudential’s Financial Consultants engage their customers more efficiently. For instance, PRUONE Express is able to generate a detailed quotation in just three seconds and uses the latest technologies, such as SmartData Capture and Fingerprint Authentication, to facilitate a quicker and more effective consultation and sales process. Launched earlier this month, all of Prudential’s Financial Consultants currently have access to PRUONE Express to complete their sales process and to submit new policy requests. Apart from improving customer experience, askPRU also creates operational efficiencies for the life insurer. Prudential estimates that approximately 30 per cent of its Financial Consultants’ queries received by its Contact Centre consultants today can be answered by askPRU. With frequently-asked queries channelled to the chatbot, Prudential’s Contact Centre consultants will be able to focus on handling more complex enquiries and provide a better service to its Financial Consultants and customers. Designed as a standalone mobile application, askPRU was developed in collaboration with NCS Pte Ltd (NCS), IBM Watson and Nokomai Studios. IBM Watson is a cognitive computing technology platform that uses natural language processing and machine learning to reveal insights from large amounts of structured and unstructured data, such as text and images. Mr. Chia Wee Boon, Chief Executive Officer of NCS, said, “We are pleased to work with Prudential to develop a cognitive-powered chatbot that provides responsive, 24/7 support to its Financial Consultants. Notably, the integration of the chatbot to Prudential’s core backend systems ensures that there is always a reliable and consistent source of information available, which translates to the Financial Consultants and their customers having instant access to accurate, real-time information.” Mr. Kenny Hay, Director of Cloud, IBM ASEAN, said, “The way in which customer relationships are built is constantly evolving. Technology such as IBM Watson has cognitive capabilities that often serve to augment human intelligence and abilities, supporting Prudential’s Financial Consultants. The pathway to self-service in real-time can certainly bring about huge growth opportunities for forward-thinking businesses.” Ms. Mae Urquhart, Director of Nokomai Studios, said, “It is a privilege to work with Prudential in transforming the data-driven expertise of NCS and IBM into an intuitive, engaging experience for the life insurer’s Financial Consultants. In particular, the close collaboration with Prudential’s Financial Consultants was crucial in the successful development of askPRU.” Keen to arrange a Data Analytics demo or to find out more?

             You can drop us a call or email Published:   - As part of a series of initiatives focusing on digital innovation, MSIG Insurance (“MSIG”) has introduced Robotic Process Automation (RPA) software into its process workflows. NCS Pte Ltd, a leading information communications technology service provider and a subsidiary of Singtel, designed the bots using UIPath RPA software. “Robotic Processing Automation presents an opportunity for insurers to digitise their processes further and enhance customer experience through faster turnaround times. NCS’ deep experience in implementing RPA has enabled us to roll out the initiative within a very short timeframe. We are seeing increased agility in our processes now that our employees are freed up to focus on higher value-added tasks. Our partnership with NCS has produced great results and we look forward to this ongoing collaboration,” said Ms Sharon Teo, Senior Vice President, Corporate Services and Project Management Office of MSIG Insurance. Mr Chia Wee Boon, Chief Executive Officer of NCS, said, “We are pleased to help MSIG leverage our expertise in Robotic Processing Automation to improve their customer experience with faster, more accurate processes. With the growing emphasis on business process enhancement through automation, we look forward to continuing our partnership with MSIG as they embrace innovation to transform customer engagement and be at the forefront of this changing technology landscape.” MSIG’s two newcomers to its virtual workforce – named Zac and Velma – have helped to improve process efficiency, cutting down the time spent on travel claims registration and motor fleet policy processing by around 70% and 80% respectively. Both bots are able to eliminate error rates by 100%. Zac processes travel claims submitted over the website, saving MSIG staff from the repetitive task of manually entering information into the system and printing out acknowledgement letters to send to claimants. Zac automates the process with immediate registration of claimant details upon online submission, and emails an acknowledgement to the claimant. This cuts down the processing time for MSIG’s travel claims registration and acknowledgement from 14 minutes to 3 minutes. Velma enters the vehicle details of new motor fleet policies into the system. Instead of taking the average 2 minutes to key in one vehicle policy, she takes 40 seconds. She is also able to handle policy validation and cancel maid or foreign workers’ policies with expired bonds from the system when instructed. Following the successful implementation of Zac and Velma, MSIG and NCS have plans to extend the partnership even further with the development of more RPAs over the next 6 months. They will develop bots to improve claims registration and policy processing for other product lines, and will extend the use of bots to other department processes if they require automation. The investment in RPA will form part of the digital roadmap that MSIG has set out to ultimately simplify customer experience and empower its employees at work.

They can also make bill payments, top up prepaid cards and Dash wallets, and get instant SIM card replacements. “The future of retail is here and now. Our digital transformation integrates online and offline customer touchpoints to deliver fresh and fuss-free buying experiences to consumers. UNBOXED fulfils the needs of today’s consumer and provides a peek into the next-generation of retail – fast, instant, convenient and experiential,” said Mr Yuen Kuan Moon, CEO of Consumer Singapore at Singtel. Currently based in the CBD at 20 Pickering Street, the pop-up store is modular and movable. Measuring 45 square metres when fully extended, it can be easily transported and reconfigured to fit different spaces. The store will move to a new location every few months to serve customers at high-traffic areas such as transport hubs and school campuses. Co-created by Singtel staff, NCS and SingPost, security for the store is provided by NCS which developed a round-the-clock security platform called Sentinel while the POPStation lockers are prefilled with devices and replenished daily using SingPost’s Last Mile Platform (“LaMP”). “We are glad that Singtel is the first retailer on the Sentinel platform. Our state-of-the-art remote security platform ensures that UNBOXED can stay truly unmanned while offering a highly secure shopping environment for consumers,” said Mr Chia Wee Boon, CEO of NCS. “SingPost is pleased to have Singtel as the first retailer on the LaMP platform. This will supercharge SingPost’s existing suite of services by integrating and synergising the entire delivery process, giving consumers and retailers a level of flexibility never before seen in the industry. We are delighted to collaborate with Singtel and look forward to unboxing the future of retail together,” said Mr Vincent Phang, CEO (Postal Services and Singapore) for SingPost. UNBOXED builds on the success of the digital transformation of Singtel’s flagship Comcentre store. It offers one of the most intelligent retail experiences in Asia, featuring an intelligent WiFi queuing system, integrated online and in-store shopping carts, and instant purchases via automated checkout. The store consistently receives an average of 99% positive customer experience scores and has won multiple accolades for its innovative approach to retail.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:     – NCS today announced a major business and people transformation to reposition the company for growth in the 5G era. The strategic reset focuses on growing digital services, scaling its government and telco business segments and capturing new growth opportunities in the enterprise sector, across the key regional markets of Singapore, Australia and Greater China. The move comes as digital economies experience a global growth spurt, accelerated in part by COVID-19, creating an unprecedented surge in demand for digital and technology services. Ng Kuo Pin, CEO of NCS said, “There isn’t a more opportune time for us to make the pivot from a traditional ICT service provider to a digital and technology services firm in Asia Pacific. COVID-19 and the mass migration online have put digital transformation on everyone’s agenda, and we intend to leverage our strengths in the public and telco sectors to capitalise on this opportunity to redefine and grow our company. We will be ramping up our offering of digital services as we reposition ourselves to capture new business from the enterprise sector and expand into the high-growth markets of Australia and Greater China where we have presence and synergies.” Earlier in May, NCS was cited as a new growth engine for the Singtel Group and has started operating as an autonomous unit within the Group since beginning of the year to realise its new remit and ambition. At the heart of this transformation is NCS NEXT, a separate service organisation created to drive the company’s new focus on digital, cloud and platform services. NEXT will complement NCS’ other core service offerings in applications, infrastructure, engineering and cyber security, and provide a differentiated and comprehensive suite of end-to-end technology services. NCS intends to hire up to 2,000 tech talent over the next two years. The past year has seen NEXT achieve key milestones, such as the launch of NEXT Shenzhen Innovation Centre; acquisition of 2359 Media, a Singapore-based mobile app digital consultancy; and the integration of DataSpark, Singtel’s analytics unit which offers unique big data and mobility intelligence services in Singapore and Australia. NCS also recently partnered C3 AI, a leader in enterprise artificial intelligence (AI) from the US, to take enterprise AI solutions to Asia Pacific. Given its proven strengths and track record of success in servicing the Singapore public sector, NCS will double down and scale this business segment with the creation of Gov+. This strategic business group will focus on building NCS’ digital government portfolio and strengthen its position as the leading digital catalyst for governments and smart cities across the Asia Pacific. A second strategic business group, Telco+, is a joint initiative between Singtel and NCS to help telecom companies transform digitally. The goal is to help telcos improve operational efficiencies and leverage data driven insights to deliver enhanced customer experiences. With the combined 5G capabilities of the Singtel Group and NCS’ expertise in digital and technology services, Telco+ will also develop a full stack of 5G-enabled solutions to help enterprises capitalise on the applications of 5G. Kuo Pin says, “The ‘plus’ in Gov+ and Telco+ signifies our intent to double down on the government and telco sectors, leveraging our expertise in servicing the public sector and the right to play in the Telco sector as part of the Singtel Group. We are committed to work even more closely with government agencies and will invest in building deep digital government capabilities to support their digital and innovation needs. Similarly, working off synergies with the Singtel Group, we stand ready to help telcos digitalise their operations so that they can go to market competitively and innovatively.” As part of its plans to expedite expansion into the enterprise sector, NCS has identified industries to focus on: Healthcare, Transportation, Financial Services, Industrial, Commercial, Communications, Media and Technology. Its expansion into Asia Pacific will be targeted, focusing on the high-growth markets of Singapore, Australia and Greater China. In December 2020, NCS launched NEXT in Australia in partnership with Optus Enterprise to deliver end-to-end ICT and digital services to the Australian enterprise market. Australia, which is Asia Pacific’s third-largest IT services market, provides access to a diversity of talent and technology. NCS aims to expand its presence in Australia through a combination of organic and inorganic means, building up digital capabilities in cloud and AI. In Greater China, which comprises both the mainland China and Hong Kong markets, NCS will concentrate on growing the enterprise business in the Healthcare, Transportation, Financial Services, Communications, Media, Technology and Manufacturing industries; while building digital capabilities in 5G, digital twin and blockchain. Kuo Pin shares, “For NCS to play well in the bigger league of technology services firms in Asia Pacific, we must be committed to grow our people, our diversity of talent, and offer them exciting and rewarding careers and opportunities. We have launched a people transformation programme surrounding culture, skill specialisation and becoming a learning organisation. This is a top priority for us.” Based on individual preference, performance and aptitude, tech professionals in NCS will have opportunities to move across specialisations, working in different regions and industries, and with different clients and partners to gain a wide range of experiences. NCS also plans to launch an immersive learning academy and platform - NCS Dojo - within the year, a place where the 10,000-strong NCS team can come together to share knowledge from real world projects through an apprentice-style practice-based approach. NCS’ transformation plan was unveiled today alongside a new brand identity and campaign, capturing its new purpose - to advance communities by partnering with governments and enterprises to harness technology and bringing people together to make the extraordinary happen. The symbol of two forward slashes in the new logo, which NCS labels as the ‘N power’ mark, represents NCS as a technology services firm and the double forward slashes used in internet URLs and in-line comments in computer programming, signify how deeply anchored NCS is in technology and its intention to leverage technology to champion transformation for governments and enterprises.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:   – NCS today announced the launch of NCS NEXT Cloud Centre of Excellence (CoE) in Melbourne. The CoE will offer governments and enterprises greater support on accelerating their cloud initiatives. This is part of NCS’ regional expansion strategy into Australia, following the partnership with Optus Enterprise in December 2020 to bring integrated ICT and digital services to Australian clients across a wide range of industries and government sectors. The CoE will also facilitate expertise exchange and deepen collaboration between Singapore and Australia, helping both cities build up cloud expertise in a competitive talent market. The setup of the CoE follows an earlier announcement made this year on the formation of NCS NEXT to help organisations leverage digital technologies to transform the way they operate. This would involve innovating and co-creating new applications, processes, and services with organisations to better service their end customers or stakeholders. NCS NEXT (CoE) in Melbourne is part of the company’s NEXT Innovation Triangle which also includes nodes in Singapore and Shenzhen and draws on the unique strengths each city brings in terms of talent, clients, and innovation. , said, “We have witnessed the increasing pace at which both public and commercial sectors in Australia are adopting a digital-first approach to transforming the way in which we live and work. Through the NCS NEXT Cloud CoE launch in Australia, Optus Enterprise and NCS can help Australian enterprises and government agencies leverage cloud-based innovations to unlock competitive advantages and enhance customer or citizen experiences. By tapping into NCS’ 40 years of experience in supporting the public sector in APAC and our strong partner ecosystem, NCS Australia will play an active role in nurturing and pushing the local ICT space forwards”. A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was also signed today at the Cloud CoE launch, with The State Government of Victoria represented by Invest Victoria as well as the Department of Treasury and Finance. This partnership leverages the CoE to promote innovation in cloud, reach new customers, drive talent development, and advance Victoria’s competitiveness in the technology sector. With 80 per cent of Australian enterprises expected to shift to cloud-centric infrastructures and applications by the end of 2021, the launch of NCS NEXT Cloud CoE comes at an opportune time to help Australian organisations navigate the complex tech ecosystem and accelerate their cloud deployment.  said, “Victoria is the tech capital of Australia and we’re so proud to welcome NCS to Melbourne, creating jobs and continuing our thriving reputation of innovation and excellence.” To support the growth of the Cloud business in Australia, NCS is also committed to building the digital talent pool in Victoria, focusing on capabilities in innovation, artificial intelligence, 5G-enabled internet of things (IoT) applications, advanced analytics and cloud. NCS aims to grow the local team to 1,500 and create 500 new digital skilled jobs over the next few years to support the needs and aspirations of the Victorian and national ICT communities.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  The Land Transport Authority (LTA) will be replacing the existing electronic road pricing (ERP) system with the next-generation (nexgen) ERP system that supports Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) technology. Central to the new system is a new vehicle on-board unit (OBU) which can provide value-added services for motorists, such as advance alerts on charging locations and real-time traffic information. However, the supply of essential microchips, which is required for the OBUs, has been affected by the worsening global shortage of microchips, a situation that is also impacting many other industries. To ensure a smooth and uninterrupted installation exercise for all motorists, the installation of OBUs is now planned to commence in the second half of 2023, instead of end-2021. 2          The COVID-19 pandemic has boosted global demand for microchips while affecting their production, following the suspension of operations in major semiconductor foundries across multiple countries. This has severely impacted the production of electronic devices across multiple sectors, from consumer electronics to industrial machines and automotive. 3          The production of the OBU has been similarly affected. Its parts need to be sourced from different suppliers and a few have indicated that they have been unable to meet the required delivery schedules for critical components. This shortage is expected to persist through 2022 and the recovery in microchip production is expected to be gradual, from end-2022 to mid-2023. Given the uncertainty in the supply chain and in order for installation to commence only when OBU production is stable and sufficient, the OBU installation exercise is now planned to commence in the second half of 2023. 4          The first OBU will be installed free of charge for existing Singapore-registered vehicles. LTA will monitor the impact of COVID-19 on the OBU installation timeline, and the current ERP system will continue to operate until the nexgen ERP is implemented. 5          LTA is working closely with its contractors NCS Pte Ltd (NCS) and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Asia Pacific Pte Ltd (MHI) to commence OBU production and prepare for the OBU installation. 6          Mr Ng Kuo Pin, CEO of NCS, said: “We will continue to work closely with our longstanding partners LTA and MHI, leveraging our combined capabilities to manage the challenges from the global microchip shortage. We will also continue with our rigorous testing on all systems and processes to support mass installation in 2023.” 7          Mr Naoaki Ikeda, President of MHI Machinery Systems, the group company of MHI involved in the OBU production, said: “We remain committed to commencing OBU production as soon as possible, and are working closely with our supply chain partners to source for the affected components and safeguard their availability for the installation exercise.” 8          Mr Ng Lang, CEO of LTA, said: “We would like to seek motorists’ understanding as we work closely with our partners to resolve the production challenges brought on by COVID-19. Our priority is to ensure that the installation exercise proceeds smoothly. We will give ample notice to motorists and motor vehicle industry ahead of the installation exercise.” The Land Transport Authority awarded the contract for developing the nexgen ERP system to the consortium of NCS Pte Ltd & Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Asia Pacific Pte Ltd in 2016. The nexgen ERP will be a technological refresh of the current physical gantry-based ERP system, which was introduced more than 20 years ago in 1998 and is increasingly more expensive to maintain. Leveraging Global Navigation Satellite System, the new system will be a more feature-rich system, going beyond congestion charging to also improve traffic management and transport planning and provide value-added services for motorists, such as advance notifications on charging locations and real-time traffic information.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:   – NCS today announced its acquisition of Australia’s largest privately-owned IT services company, The Dialog Group (Dialog), to better support the Australian public sector and enterprise clients in addressing their rising digital transformation needs. The acquisition of Dialog for A$325 million (S$325 million) is geared to unlock new growth opportunities in the Australian market and accelerate NCS’ regionalisation strategy. Reputed for its extensive services portfolio from IT consulting, application development to managed application services, Dialog has presence across Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra, Perth, Darwin, and Adelaide. , said, “This acquisition is a significant step in the regionalisation of NCS and leverages the combined strengths of NCS and Dialog and their established track records and reputations across both Singapore and Australia. The scale of this acquisition, our largest to date, reflects our firm commitment to growing our business beyond the shores of Singapore, particularly in Australia where we can also leverage the strategic presence of the Singtel Group.” The acquisition combines Dialog’s core IT capabilities and NCS NEXT digital services to bolster its focus on innovation, cloud, artificial intelligence and data analytics. It also trebles the number of highly skilled IT specialists in its operations in Australia to 1,300 - ready to support clients from a multitude of sectors including government, healthcare, transport, communications, financial and commercial services. This combination of talent and expertise will create a stronger end-to-end suite of technology and digital services for NCS’ clients in Australia and across the region. Ng added, “At NCS, our purpose is to advance our communities by harnessing technology and bringing people together to make the extraordinary happen. Similarly, Dialog’s commitment to clients and technology has made it one of the leading tech companies in Australia, serving both government and enterprise clients. This alignment of purpose makes Dialog a perfect fit. Collectively, our capabilities, talent and reach will fortify and consolidate our position in Australia and help our clients and the industry meet the digital transformation demands of the future economy.” As part of its transformational growth plan, NCS has been scaling its presence in Australia since December 2020 to serve clients in Australia through NCS NEXT, its digital innovation and services arm - which supports enterprises’ growing demand for digital transformation solutions. Together, Dialog and NCS will have greater opportunities for synergistic growth between Australia and Singapore as well as expertise to better support the needs of clients across both markets. This latest deal follows NCS NEXT’s acquisition of Riley, a cloud consultancy with dedicated expertise in Google cloud applications and a majority investment in Eighty20 Solutions, a cloud transformation specialist with unique capabilities across Microsoft cloud platforms, thus offering a ‘best-of-cloud' service portfolio to the Australian market. Mr Alan Key, Dialog’s CEO commented, “Together, we will have a strong breadth and depth of capabilities and expertise for our clients here in Australia. Both NCS and Dialog’s talent development cultures and programmes will develop the best talent pipeline and create exciting jobs and growth opportunities.” According to Gartner, IT spending in Australia is showing its strongest growth in a decade and is projected to grow 6.5% in 2022. The largest IT spending segment in Australia is IT services, which is expected to grow to A$39 billion in 2022 . With one of the highest Net-Promoter Scores (NPS) in the industry and a long-standing client base of governments and large enterprises, Dialog understands the unique needs of the market and augments NCS’ commitment to better serve a diverse range of clients in Government, Healthcare, Transportation, Financial Services, Industrial, Commercial, Communications, Media, and Technology sectors. Government and enterprise clients can now access deep-tech capabilities across 55 specialisations to support their transformation needs including harnessing innovative digital and cloud technologies. They will also be able to leverage synergies from NCS NEXT Innovation Centres, spanning Singapore and Melbourne, to drive innovation through cross-border collaboration and co-creation. The newly combined NCS and Dialog will unlock synergies in talent development and build a steady pipeline of tech talent for the Australian market. With the increased market presence, NCS and Dialog employees will have more options to achieve personal growth and mastery, opportunities to move across specialisations and work in various regions and industries, with different clients and partners to gain a wide range of experience. Depending on their skillsets and areas of interest, they also get to be involved in exciting and impactful projects, reflecting NCS’ commitment to building a place for talent to grow and thrive professionally. The completion of the acquisition is subject to fulfilment of closing conditions, including relevant approvals from regulatory authorities and other third parties, and is expected to be completed within three months.

Headquartered in Melbourne, with offices in Sydney and Brisbane, ARQ has deep expertise in cloud, digital, data and analytics solutions, and is one of the fastest-growing digital services company in Australia. ARQ’s revenue is projected to reach A$118M by end 2022 representing a year-on-year increase of 38%, while EBITDA is projected to increase to A$18.4M. The acquisition price represents an EV/EBITDA multiple of 15.7 times , reflecting NCS’ confidence in the prospects of ARQ and expected synergies with the rest of its operations. This investment is NCS’ fourth in Australia in the past 15 months as it expands its footprint in a market strategic to its regionalisation plans. NCS recently acquired Australia’s largest privately-owned IT services company, The Dialog Group (Dialog) following 2 previous investments: cloud consultancy Riley that specialises in Google cloud applications and a majority investment in cloud transformation specialist Eighty20 Solutions that has unique capabilities across Microsoft platforms. , said, “This latest acquisition completes a jigsaw of strategic investments in Australia, ramping up our presence in a market that is critical to our regional expansion. Combined with Dialog’s core IT capabilities and extensive reach across 8 Australian cities, ARQ brings on board the right digital competencies that help create a highly compelling end-to-end digital transformation value proposition. Taken together, our four investments to date have given us the necessary scale, capabilities and credibility to compete as a regional digital powerhouse as we help governments and enterprises in Singapore and Australia achieve their digital transformation goals.” As one of the largest fast-growing digital services providers in Australia, ARQ has a strong client coverage and serves half of ASX’s top 20 companies across diverse sectors in financial services, utilities, retail, healthcare, travel and government. This includes ANZ bank, AustralianSuper, Domino’s, Qantas, Transurban, nib, NAB, The Coffee Club, NSW Rural Fire Services, Queensland Government – Department of Education, Victoria State Government – Department of Transport, and more. ARQ has a strong partnership ecosystem across major cloud hyperscalers in Australia and its expertise in delivering tailored tech innovation at scale through its 560-strong team will bolster NCS NEXT capabilities in digital, cloud, data and platforms to fulfill growing digital transformation demand in Australia’s large addressable market. IDC expects that Digital services in APAC will grow at a CAGR of 14.6% from 2020 to 2025, reaching US$170.6 billion in 2025. In Australia, Digital services are expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.7% from 2020 to 2025 to US$12.1 billion in 2025. , said, “Joining the NCS family is a tremendous opportunity to continue growing the business as it now allows us to go international and serve regional clients besides capturing more domestic market share by leveraging synergies within NCS. We are well primed for expansion, having grown our government footprint to over a third of our business, acquired many new customers and hired 300 new talents on board. We intend to keep optimising NCS’ world-class IT and digital capabilities to keep building innovative solutions for our clients.” As part of its transformational growth plan, NCS has been scaling its presence in Australia since December 2020 to serve Australian clients through NCS NEXT, its digital innovation and services arm - which supports enterprises’ growing demand for digital transformation solutions. , said, “We look forward to welcoming ARQ into the NCS NEXT family. ARQ’s highly experienced and scalable agile teams will become part of NEXT as one regional digital team to serve clients across the region in the post-pandemic era. Together, we will unlock more synergies between Australia and Singapore and enable cross-pollination of tech innovation.” ARQ’s 560-strong team will increase NCS’ headcount in Australia to 1,900 and build a robust tech talent pipeline to support the growing digital transformation needs of clients in the region. With increased workforce mobility, employees and future talents will be able to explore diverse and exciting career opportunities across various geographies and industries to serve clients through a hybrid delivery model. ARQ embraces a strong people culture and its talents adopt an innovation-first mindset to design and develop solutions – evident in their 572 technical certifications, 62 design awards and 17 certified partnerships. NCS’ focus on an apprenticeship-based learning culture is similar to ARQ Academy’s emphasis on self-learning and innovation, and the combination of both teams will reinvent talent development and answers the tech talent crunch in both Australia and Singapore. The acquisition is subject to the receipt of the relevant regulatory approvals and is expected to complete by May 2022.

This joint pilot aims to elevate the experience of beachgoers by providing guests a more convenient way to get their meals. During the one-month pilot, which takes place from early May, guests will be able to get their food delivered to Emerald Pavilion and Sapphire Pavilion along Siloso Beach. Two F&B brands, Ola Beach Club and Summerhouse Beach Club at Skypark Sentosa by AJ Hackett, will be participating in the pilot. Consumers can also enjoy variety and value with Grab’s Mix-and-Match and Self Pick-up features built into the pilot, allowing Sentosa’s beachgoers to order from the two F&B brands at one go and have their dining offerings delivered by  to the pick-up points at the pavilions.

If Anyone Can Inspire Digital Trust, It’s Us – Developers if anyone can inspire digital trust, it’s us – developers Contact Us Thank you for your interest. In the world of big data and Artificial Intelligence (AI), digital trust underpins continued growth and development. However, building a strong, reliable, safe and secure digital trust ecosystem is no easy matter. No free rider is allowed – regulators, tech companies, consumers, and at the heart of it, ethical DevOps are all essential. It all starts with secured and quality software Why security should not be an afterthought The case for shift left security How to make shift left security work explore more 
                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  But with everyone in DevOps talking about being agile, and failing fast and learning fast today, where does quality stand? How can we strike a balance between speed and quality? Or what measures can we put in place to harmonise them? Typically, two approaches are most commonly applied in ensuring software quality – do quality checks after the design and development cycle, or continuously throughout the development phase. While the former is a common practice traditionally, the latter typically offers fewer problems and surprises at the end. By starting small, chewing little, validating, testing and then progressing a little more, it fits the ideology of fail fast and learn fast. And even when nothing fails, insights gained can help optimise long term goals, and move the development along. In a nutshell, this is shift left security. Contrast this method with waterfall monolith applications where testing is only conducted at the end. Not only is it likely that we will end up with a long list of issues that need fixing, we may also have to redesign modules or patch in complex workarounds to resolve issues that could have been circumvented totally if checks were conducted earlier. That’s not a great way to design – obviously. You’ll ask – what then is a better approach for DevOps? Well, take a Jenkins build pipeline that churns out software sub modules. We’ll want to embed quality checks into every pipeline processing each software sub module and deal with arising issues incrementally instead of having a surprise when codes are assembled and run. Try imposing this concept into a manufacturing line setup that runs from left to right. Quality checks should be implemented as much left as possible and practical before the final code assembly comes – in other words, shift left the quality checks. If issues can be detected early, they can be fixed early. Importantly, costs of rolling back major design decisions and architecture rebuild can be avoided. Shift left security sounds great in concept. But, how well the development team embraces it will depend on the pipeline design. Do we design code build, scan, test and deploy into a single pipeline? Definitely not – else every build will take hours if not days to run. Developers are keen to find out if the code they build integrates well with the rest, and that needs to be done as often as possible – preferably once a day based on a trunk approach. Therefore, breaking up build, scan, test and deploy into respective pipelines is the best way to allow developers flexibility to increase the velocity and efficiency of the DevOps process. Depending on how long scans or automated testing runs are, weekly or even longer batch jobs can be scheduled to accommodate that. Other determining factors include how fast codes are generated and how large the development is. By now, it should be clear why adopting shift left security in code development is preferred – from more efficient software rollout to alleviating security domain issues. Moreover, commercial and open-source tools are readily available in the market to help us with its implementation. For your easy reference, I’ve listed examples in various categories in the box.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  HTX, NCS and its partners, principally A*STAR, developed an autonomous ground robot, Xavier, to support a joint project involving five public agencies, namely HTX, National Environment Agency, Land Transport Authority, Singapore Food Agency, and Housing & Development Board. The project aims to deter undesirable social behaviours such as smoking in prohibited areas, illegal hawking and riding of motorised mobility devices on footpaths. Once Xavier detects any of the above, it triggers real-time alerts to the command-and-control centre, and displays scenario-based messages to educate the public. The trial deployment of Xavier supported the work of public officers by reducing the manpower required for foot patrols and improved operation efficiency. Amidst the pandemic, various government agencies needed reinforcements to enhance public health and safety. A solution was needed to augment surveillance and enforcement resources, while keeping its officers safe. Xavier was created and deployed placed on trial. A highly versatile robot that can be customised for a widespread application in different fields and operational environments. Tele-operated via NCS’s fleet management platform, robotmanager, Xavier enhanced the workforce needs of multiple government agencies. Some of the ground robot’s features include: Xavier was put on 3-week trial to patrol and survey an area with high foot traffic within Toa Payoh Central. It supported the workforce needs of multiple government agencies and helped achieve greater operational efficiency while enhancing public health and safety.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  Every year, in the five days following the announcement of GCE “O” level results, some 50,000 secondary school students in Singapore will go online to the Joint Admission Exercise (JAE) system to select their preferred junior colleges, polytechnics or tertiary institutions. Within days of applications closing, the system would have computed the various options filled in by the students, factored in special admission criteria, different admission schemes and other parameters, and matched each application against available places to arrive at the posting results, which are then communicated to students via SMS or online. The JAE backend system is one of several developed by NCS to support the student cycle from primary one registration to the administration of the post-secondary education accounts. The Primary One System is used to register pupils a year before they are slated to begin school. As they move on to the next phase of their education, the Secondary One System supports the annual secondary one posting exercise where students who pass their Primary School Leaving Examinations (PSLE) are posted to a secondary school based on their results and choice of schools. On completion of secondary school, the JAE system handles postings for the next phase of the student’s education journey. At each juncture, where there is a national examination, the Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board uses the web-based iExams system to manage the operations.   This article was first published in NCS SG50 Book “Technology Evolution”, 2015 (NLB BRN:201353230) Share this article on: Discover how you can chart your career and elevate your skills.

                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  Have you ever wondered how large Digital Native Organisations (DNO’s) like Google, Apple, Uber, Airbnb, WeChat, Facebook, Amazon, Weibo, LinkedIn and others seem to read your mind, amazing you with delightful suggestions and new ideas that are just the kind of things that you’re interested in?  Sometimes, it’s strange how it works. You may often find yourself thinking, ‘ ’.    It can be a digital content provider prompting you to watch a movie that appeals to you, or alerting you to an upcoming sports event that you love.  Maybe, it’s a social media platform pushing out content that hits the spot – being of the right topic, time and perspective.  The list goes on and on – exciting shopping suggestions, perfectly timed entertainment options, a wellness retreat just when you’re feeling burnt out, and many more targeted, attractive and personalised suggestions. Does it work? Do they get you engaged?  Yes, quite often – but not always.  When the suggestions work, they work extremely well. Even if they don’t motivate you to action, they get you thinking about things you may never have considered before. What’s going on here? How do DNO’s have the knack for consistently knowing what you need at the right time?  The short answer is, they know because we tell them! We reveal huge amounts of information about ourselves – sometimes intentionally and often unintentionally.  We tell them what we like and don’t like. They know our schedules and habits, and they know who we talk to, how often and for how long. They know where we go, at what times and what routes we use. Additionally, DNO’s are incredibly aware of interesting things happening in our world – things that we might not know.  When they combine their knowledge about our interests, concerns and passions with a vast awareness of what’s happing in our world, they make magic happen by creating an engaging 360-degree picture tailored to each of us. When we subscribe to any digital service, we give permission for them to collect, store and analyse all kinds of information in order to synthesise a model of us.  DNO’s have access to unimaginably large amounts of technology to conduct real-time analysis of the data they collect.  As technology costs trend ever cheaper, the DNO’s are enabled to use more technologies to build predictive patterns of individuals using Machine Learning (ML) models in conjunction with other Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities. The ML models cycle though iterations of learning until they can accurately provide predictable outcomes for certain situations. They then execute accurate scenario analyses predicting individual future behaviors instantly.  Once the ML-predicted behaviour is forecasted, other AI systems suggest the best course of action to sway the situation towards a positive direction for the DNO. Why go to all the trouble of personalising and harmonising subscriber profiles right down to the individual level?  It’s done to engage us – to encourage us to interact with DNO’s and remain their customers for longer periods.  They do this for several reasons. First, retaining existing customers is often many times cheaper compared to attracting new ones. Second, engaged customers can be targeted with pinpoint accuracy for upsell offers. Third, AI/ML can monitor subscribers and detect usage inflection points caused by changes in their behavior. These points often represent an opportunity to upsell, or identify a subscriber behaving in a way that suggests they are considering leaving the service. Inflections trigger AI processes to analyse the best course of proactive intervention to best engage with the subscriber. If the AI informs us of an upsell opportunity, an automated robot is connected with the subscriber to interact and attempt to close the deal. On the other hand, if the AI tells us that the subscriber is likely to leave (churn) soon, either a robot or an employee may contact the subscriber and utilise retention strategies suggested by the AI. Obviously, organisations need the necessary people and strategies in place to be able to act immediately on the insights that the AI/ML provides. Does this level of large scale personalisation make good business sense?  A recent study by McKinsey found that by using AI/ML tools to engage subscribers, it’s possible to increase revenue by up to 10 per cent, while at the same time improving customer engagement by 20 to 30 per cent.  So, yes it makes a lot of business sense to have this capability (McKinsey & Company, February 24, 2022).  However, not all organisations are progressing on a journey to scale-up their customer-360 projects because they are trapped in old technology siloes that don’t directly provide the data that AI systems need. Mass-personalisation is applicable to any organisation that has a sizable subscriber base such as utilities, banks and communications service providers (CSP’s).  As an example, CSP’s often find themselves in a situation where they have vast amounts of information about their subscribers. However, it’s not stored in a way that allows them to build a 360-degree picture.  Indeed, only a small percentage of CSP’s have successfully developed their full 360-degree capabilities and even fewer are using them effectively to intervene, upsell and reduce churn.  This is despite the huge commercial upside opportunities being more than enough to fund development of these capabilities. If mass-personalisation capabilities lead to improved customer satisfaction, revenue and profitability – what options are available to organisations like CSP’s trapped by legacy silo systems?  First, AI/ML, cloud storage and compute are standard technologies and readily available to anyone. Further, data scientists can provide the expertise to draw up a customer-360 picture to provide coherent personal subscriber recommendations at scale, ensuring the capability is accessible by everyone.  Second, technologies like a data-mesh or data-lake can ingest information from all kinds of systems and transform islands of information into new synthetic representations such as a customer-360 picture.  Third, while some organisations may not be collecting full 360-degree subscriber data, this is not an unsolvable problem. Doing something is better than nothing, and a data-mesh or data-lake can be continuously extended over time to build a more complete picture. The next frontier in managing customer value over their lifetime is to bring in external data to augment the ML models and AI recommendations. As an example, what would ML and AI predict across your subscriber base if the competition introduced a new service that was superior to your offer? Which subscribers would be impacted, what would be the risk of churn, and what is the best intervention strategy to adopt? Now add regulatory change impacts, international impacts, emerging challenger competitive threats and anything else going on in the world that might get your subscribers considering a change in their service. Market leaders have already conducted these kinds of analyses to build resilient customer relationships, yielding much higher than average revenues, profits and customer engagement. Although this saying about power and responsibility has ancient roots, today it is ever more relevant, often used by figures such as Winston Churchill, Spiderman and many others. Recently, there have been several highly-publicised abuses of power of large-scale personalization. These cases have targeted susceptible cohorts for the purpose of gradually shaping their thinking to intentionally drive behavioral outcomes that may have not otherwise occurred.  As an example, much has been written and debated about on efforts to use personalised social media data to shape the outcomes of electoral contests in several geographies. The abuse of AI/ML mass-personalisation for nefarious purposes has raised awareness that organisations that collect and analyse data must uphold their responsibility towards their data donors by using their power to do good. Many social media organisations are constantly reviewing how they utilise their significant AL/ML resources in ways that do not cross ethical boundaries, as should any organisation aiming to deploy this powerful piece of technology.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  The next generation of connectivity, 5G, has kickstarted major transformations in various industries and paved the way for the development of novel use cases and business models. However, the benefits derived from the leap of 4G to 5G (with enhanced speed, connectivity, and reliability) is still an area of uncertainty for many enterprises and industrials. To better understand how and where enterprises can succeed in capitalizing opportunities to transform and monetize with 5G, we examine some compelling business transformations best practices with 5G through the age of 5G industrial revolution. Source:  To better showcase evolving business models, we examine several innovative use cases that players in key industries have employed to take their business to the next level with 5G: Manufacturers typically rely on the Quality of Service (QoS) of underlying communications to support real-time data processing, machine-to-machine-to-human communications, and industrial automation. In the past, communication and synchronization was not possible without pervasive connections throughout the facility which has been made possible with 5G today. These advancements empower manufacturers to utilise big data for analysis more effectively with a comprehensive QoS network. For manufacturers, the adoption of private 5G networks is a growing trend – over three quarters of manufacturing organisations in developed countries aim to adopt private 5G by 2024 ( ). Private 5G are networks designed for specific applications or use cases with indoor and outdoor coverage and a high degree of security, providing the user complete control over data, security, and network. Large-scale private 5G deployments require ongoing maintenance and IT resources to maintain and are usually adopted by larger organisations and can achieve high ROI. In contrast, public 5G can be deployed on-the-go, and even through an as-a-service, low-cost deployment model. This enables users to get started quicker and synergises with other IT applications for a wider range of use cases. In Ericsson’s Smart Factory based in Texas, US, its deployment of next-generation 5G technology at the site and its subsequent impact – an impressive 2.2 times improved output per employee, compared to a similar site without such automation and operational improvements ( ). How did they achieve it? Ericsson introduced video analytics to monitor worker safety thereby reducing the number of workplace incidents involving workers. Deployment of Autonomous Guided Vehicles (AGVs) aided to automate unpacking, transporting, and organising of materials in factory, freeing workers to focus on more productive activities. Furthermore, 5G-powered augmented reality to enable remote experts to provide technical guidance for factory teams boosts collaboration and skill levels of workers. As with Ericsson’s smart factory case, 5G networks has demonstrated ability to be deployed for specific on-premises applications. With upgraded 5G networks, manufacturers also benefit by unlocking new technologies to maximise efficiency and productivity while building additional revenue streams – today and in the future. Global challenges around the pandemic over the last two years have forced many retailers to go out of business, while others have had to find a way to pivot and increase their online footprint to reconnect with customers. 5G for retail aims to create superior customer experiences and innovate traditional retail facilities and touchpoints. An interesting way retail business are evolving is through the development and growth of use cases in the metaverse – a virtual reality 3-dimensional space where individuals can interact to work, play, shop, socialize. In 2021, Nike launched its own metaverse Nikeland on Roblox where visitors can compete with each other, attend events, and even shop for clothing to dress their avatar ( ). 5G plays a crucial role in supporting a fully functioning metaverse by providing ultra-low latency and high throughput allowing multiple number of users connect to the same metaverse server and interact with each other in real-time. On top of foundational connectivity, most users interact on the metaverse using personal headsets. For practical reasons, these headsets should be light, cooling, and have lasting battery life – meaning that most of the processing capabilities must be shifted away from the device and onto the Edge. This, therefore, requires real-time connectivity and high bandwidth to support massive data transfer that only 5G can support. However, while these forays into the metaverse may help future-proof a business, such nascent technologies have yet to be adopted at scale. Not all retailers have adopted 5G in such manner. In Singapore, an autonomous store start-up, Cloudpick, has established four of its stores around various university campuses in Singapore. Powered by artificial intelligence (AI) utilizing computer vision, Cloudpick employs smart shelves and sensors to track product removal and returns as well as when products leave the store – thereafter automatically charging customers for what was bought. The store can leverage on 5G’s high bandwidth and low latency features to collect and process all data from sensors and video feeds around the store. This empowers instantaneous response to customer actions, therefore providing a seamless retail experience that can be delivered to customers round-the-clock. This is an alternative approach to integrating 5G with a physical retail experience to create a convenient experience for customers. Over the coming years, investments in 5G for transport in technologies such as Multi-access Edge Compute (MEC) will enable smarter and safer transportation from connected vehicles to autonomous transport to smart traffic ecosystems. 5G’s enhanced bandwidth and ultra-low latency features support real-time big data capture and analysis on MEC, enabling vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication and a wide array of innovations that can transform the way people travel. Self-driving cars can be one such way – altering the way people move from products (purchasing vehicles) to services (paying based on distance travelled). The shift towards “mobility-as-a-service” (MaaS) also represent a convergence of data, software, hardware within the transportation industry. To fully unlock the potential of MaaS, enterprises involved along the supply chain must leverage their technologies on robust networks, such as 5G, to support mission critical MaaS. With the right partners and network, MaaS providers (from components vendors to mobility providers) can earn massive revenues built on a refreshed business model. In Henan, China, Yutong has transformed itself beyond just a bus manufacturer to an autonomous fleet operator ( ). Although public transport has always been the traditional form of MaaS, building a consumer-centric, on-demand fleet of autonomous bus transforms the way passengers travel. Passengers can now hail an autonomous bus from their location and be sent to their intended destination, while the bus picks up other passengers along the route and plans the most optimal route to take. To successfully implement such a solution, Yutong built an intelligent public transportation system solution based on the 5G network, integrated “vehicle-road-network-cloud” systems and orchestrated the integration of their network transportation system and their autonomous bus. With 5G technology, traffic management systems and infrastructure such as roads, traffic monitoring traffic lights and pedestrian paths can greatly shift in the way they are utilised and monetised. Furthermore, these innovations can facilitate smart vehicle solutions, public and private safety features, real-time traffic analysis and routing, smart pedestrian services, etc. To transform the future of transportation means leveraging 5G to create more efficient, safe, and reliable vehicles and traffic systems integrated seamlessly with the environment and surrounding infrastructure, which has the potential to transform both the industry and people’s lives. The need for greater accessibility to healthcare has never been greater – pandemic-driven demand, longer life expectancy, increasing complexity of medical cases. These factors constantly strain the operations of healthcare facilities and providers, resulting in increased healthcare and insurance cost, while stretching the limited healthcare resources available. The role that 5G plays as a critical enabler in healthcare is therefore massive. It enables transformation of the most critical elements within healthcare, by improving the quality of connections to better meet provider and patient needs accurately, efficiently, and quickly. 5G also brings about improved network consistency and enhanced security with private 5G, ensuring reliable and secure connection within hospitals at all times. As 5G becomes ubiquitous within healthcare through advances in robotics, Internet-of-Things (IoT) and AI, a connected healthcare ecosystem can be established that paves the way to the development of smart connected hospitals. Within the evolving healthcare industry, providing higher quality of healthcare starts with quality training and an engaged community of providers. In some hospitals and universities, medical training facilities have been upgraded with 5G and cloud technology. With latency less than 10ms and ability to compute on the MEC, many real-life scenarios can be replicated and performed in a simulation. Furthermore, healthcare providers can instantaneously access real-time support and collaborate with seamless connection using 5G. When hospitals mature and transform into smart connected hospitals, as is the case of a hospital in Guangdong, total patient care becomes more dynamic and personal. A full 5G healthcare facility, this hospital combined big data and AI to work with medical practitioners to offer services improving the convenience of diagnoses and treatments and connected communication. These services include connected autonomous robots for delivery and disinfection, IoT platform for traffic management, inventory tracking and facility sensors, smart ambulances as mobile hospitals with real-time connection to specialists, and also telemedicine for remote consultation. As a result, these initiatives led to better overall healthcare for patients in the hospital and at home, instant transmission of critical information, and reducing the cost of healthcare for both providers and patients. As the healthcare system continues to undergo immense pressure, the adoption of 5G along with other cutting-edge technologies can play a critical role in transforming many aspects of healthcare. This in turn can improve overall experience for both providers and patients and build a resilient foundation for smart healthcare systems for the future. The transition to 5G is more uncertain and complex compared to previous generations of networks. If enterprises are determined to unlock the value of 5G, they must look to quickly build, test, and launch use cases most suitable to their business needs to effectively realise benefits of advanced networks. Simultaneously, working with trusted partners on innovation and transformation can accelerate the realisation of 5G value and unlock opportunities within the organisation over the long term. While there is massive potential for enterprises to transform, being clear about what needs to be built and how to build it are key considerations for complete transformation with 5G.   . Pick & GO.

                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  The private sector has embraced for decades what the public sector is only now realising: that customer experience is king. Citizens are increasingly expecting the same level of personalised, intuitive, and seamless service from their own governments. Public sector officials around the world have to rethink how they engage with people - redesigning service moments to make them increasingly citizen-centric. At the Innovation Labs World Summit organised by GovInsider, service design experts from public and private sector shared four key tips to improve citizen experiences and make service moments count. First, governments should take the time to understand a problem from multiple angles. Daniel Santos, Service Designer at LabX, the innovation unit of Portugal’s Administration Modernisation Agency, believes that simply accepting a project brief can lead to a biased view from the outset. Such briefs often cover only one siloed perspective, he pointed out. And results-based approaches place too much emphasis on delivering a product, instead of finding the right solution, he noted. “Oftentimes, we go over a loop like this for very long until we have something out, and when it's delivered, it doesn’t solve the problem anymore,” Santos explained during a breakout session presented in partnership with NCS Digital. Instead, the government should spend time getting a more holistic understanding of the situation from different perspectives. For instance, Santos and the team at LabX had recently worked with several private and public services to design a Death and Bereavement services desk. The team conducted in-depth interviews with citizens who had lost loved ones, conducted a web analysis of searches on the topic, as well as a statistical analysis of the most popular services. This 360-degree look at the problem led to a more integrated and humane experience for family members, Santos said. “We know if we use one method only, we will get biased by that tool,” he remarked. Mohammed Hardi, Deputy Director of the Programmes Division at the Municipal Services Office (MSO), Ministry of National Development of Singapore, advised building on top of tried-and-tested solutions, instead of starting from scratch. “Don’t change your base feature - improve upon it, use what you have before. And I can tell you one thing - that’s never going to change,” he said. The new Parking.sg app designed by MSO helps people find and pay for parking. Before, the map on the app wasn’t accurate enough to pinpoint specific parking spaces. Instead, the team looked at maps used by ridesharing service Grab, that allows the user to manually drop pins on specific spots. “So what we did, we looked at Grab, we said, ‘Hey, let’s drop the pin on the spot, let’s move the map’,” he added. The app also integrated information from road experts in Singapore to identify 25 of the most difficult car parks to navigate in the city to help first-time visitors, Hardi remarked. The team also recognised the hassle of needing to type on the app while driving, and instead uses keywords to identify locations. Mark Wee, Executive Director at the DesignSingapore Council, emphasised the importance of including all stakeholders in designing solutions. Wee used the example of the Home and Community Masterplan, developed to reinvent caregiving in Singapore: “We wanted to transform the caregiving experience in Singapore by first understanding caregivers’ issues,” he explained. The plan includes rebranding caregiving - removing negative attitudes attached to the job, such as feelings of isolation, fatigue and loss, with positive experiences of trust and compassion. The project involved caregivers, healthcare professionals, and social workers coming together and sharing their experiences. These were summarised into nine key insights. Solutions compiled from the caregivers included a virtual CareHub to help train caregivers and create a community to engage with, as well as a comprehensive toolkit with a resource guide and tools designed to facilitate meaningful conversations with caregivers, he shared. “The result was a comprehensive proposal to actually build an ecosystem to support a rising number of caregivers in anticipation of our ageing population, through design thinking with different levels of impact - from policy to personal,” explained Wee. Kuai Ser Leng, Associate Director at NCS Digital, identified the importance of using data to personalise user experiences. Citizen-centric services, Kuai said, does not only cater to a group - it caters to the individual. With data, organisations can respond in real time to users to improve their experience. “With technology today you're able to always be sensing what is going on, you're always ready. And you're always learning so that you can be better,” he added. Take the example of a zoo, Kuai continued: with real-time data, managers can see which enclosures are the most crowded. They can then redirect visitors away from the crowded spots - with a special discount on ice cream. “You get customer satisfaction potentially, at the same time you might actually make money from the sales of ice cream,” he pointed out. Over time, with more data, a knowledge base can be built to refine user experiences further. As an ex-prison officer, Kuai recounted how he faced problems getting information on the education backgrounds of his inmates. But today, with all these data at their fingertips, prison officers can better design rehabilitation programmes for inmates. The previous Commissioner of Prisons and current CEO of Singapore Polytechnic is gamifying services through available data, explained Kuai. Gamification entices users to learn and interact with the system better. At Singapore Polytechnic, it can help students prepare by assigning lessons and classes based on their results. “All this could be done because you have gamification in the algorithm, all built in within the systems that are talking to another,” he added. As the world goes digital and an era of mass customisation caters to every individual’s unique needs, the public sector needs to keep up to make every service moment experience for citizens a good one.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  The Singapore Prison Service (SPS) is transforming itself into a future-ready agency by harnessing digital technologies. NCS collaborated with SPS to deploy the Prison Operations & Rehabilitation System (PORTS) and the Digitisation of Inmate Rehabilitation and Corrections Tool (DIRECT) to enable its “Prison Without Guards” and ‘Prison Without Walls’ initiatives. The SPS is facing challenges to balance between enhancing rehabilitation journey through the web for studies and communications while managing security vulnerabilities due to the increased demand for data storage and web access points.  PORTS collates all information into a 24/7 centralised database–facilitating operations system with real-time access to inmates’ info. DIRECT is a suite of apps designed to roll out customised programmes to inmates based on their risks and needs, through a secured web network for rehabilitees’ studies, communication and data access points.  Both PORTS and DIRECT helped the SPS to enhance its operational efficiency and automate its work processes on a more secured digital platform – thus allowing officers to spend more time on strategic tasks. The use of technology also improved the digital literacy of rehabilitees, which aims to break the cycle of re-offending and ease them back into society. Going electronic has cut down ‘manual and tedious processes’, such as the screening, sorting and distribution of hard-copy letters and newspapers. It helps to free up an officer's time to focus on higher value work, such as engaging with the inmates and helping them with their rehabilitation. It stretches the hours that they (inmates) can be engaged meaningfully, even when they are in their cells. Now, we can reach out to hundreds of inmates at one time”.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  To stay relevant and sustain growth, organisations today are constantly evolving their products and services and this is no different with education providers. Specifically, Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) have ventured into growth areas through the setup of new specialisations to cater to various groups of learners. IHLs have also stepped up their collaboration with industry and government partners on initiatives such as research, training, internship and volunteering opportunities. The changing landscape of the higher education sector means that areas such as grant and fund management are becoming increasingly complex. IHLs are looking to achieve greater visibility on business performance across all teams and leverage data-driven analysis to drive better decision-making. As the gatekeeper of key financial and operational data, finance teams in IHLs need to stay agile and employ actionable insights at every turn so that business leaders can make informed decisions. An IHL client currently uses basic accounting software to maintain its financial records and provide appropriate financial reporting. With evolving financial reporting requirements, they are looking for a financial management software solution that meets their requirements to standardise, harmonise, automate and streamline its financial, operational and business processes. The IHL envisaged a system that not only complies with financial reporting standards and the institute’s accounting policy and procedures but is also aligned with industry best practices. The IHL partners with NCS to implement a standardised financial management system that can seamlessly integrate its financial, procurement and budgeting processes on SAP S/4HANA Cloud Solution. The S/4HANA Cloud Solution runs on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and enables real-time analysis using large transaction data in S/4HANA with S/4HANA Embedded Analytics. It will optimally support business users in defined business processes with decision support and information at the users’ fingertips.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  A NCS client in the tourism industry had challenges in creating new environments in their infrastructure for application team. This led to long turnaround time to create business value as application had to install hardware and provision necessary software. Customer needed a fast way to manage the infrastructure by auto provisioning its server farm and use technology to manage the application build using CI/CD DevSecOps to ensure that secured applications are developed. Creating business value using technology and delivering it quickly to business advantage is a continuous challenge. Hosting applications securely, rapidly setting up the environment and using shift left technology to develop secure applications are some of the technologies an organisation needs to adopt to rise to the challenge of creating business value. To address this, NCS helped the client develop a platform using Amazon Web Services (AWS) which will enable it to embark on agile and secure development. The solution taps on AWS’s infrastructure and platform services to create a virtual private cloud. This provides scalable and secure development and hosting environment to rapidly develop and deploy applications using continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD). The platform includes commercial off-the-shelf tools as well as AWS services that work hand in hand to enable the feedback cycle required for CI/CD. For example, Ansible and Terraform is used to support the multi-cloud implementation. Integration was done with tools like Jira to provision resources on AWS such as Amazon EC2, Amazon S3 and Amazon Relational Data Services (RDS) in an orderly and predictable fashion while AWS CloudWatch enables development teams to collect and access all the performance and operational data in form of logs and metrics from a single platform. One of the main benefits in using AWS Services is that client does not have to build and any own hosting infrastructure, but can build and deploy its applications in the cloud environment on a pay-per-use basis. The resources can be scaled on demand, taking away the guesswork surrounding capacity planning. This delivers significant savings as the agency no longer has to procure more resources upfront to cater to projected growth in demand, but instead subscribe to the resources as and when they are needed. New application environments can be spun up quickly – from 30 minutes up to a maximum of 4 hours, compared with the traditional procurement and provisioning process which could take 4 to 8 weeks after a resource request has been approved. By providing development teams with access to cloud-native tools, AWS Services eliminates the need for them to devote manpower resources to maintaining these capabilities. At the same time, shift left practices ensure that tests are carried out early in the development cycle to ensure the delivery of quality code.

                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  In the age of hyper-digitalisation, things move fast. New digital technologies are seemingly emerging every day and, as they gain traction in all spheres of life, these technologies are transforming organisations and entire industries at an unprecedented rate. In this article we’ll be looking at some of the most significant technological trends driving change in six key industries.   Across sectors there are some universal truths. It has almost become a cliché to say that consumers and citizens today are more informed, connected and demanding than ever, but it’s undeniably true. They expect the highest standards of speed, availability, personalisation, choice, and security in all their digital interactions. This means governments and enterprises across all sectors need to have a 360-degree view of their customers’ online digital experience and journey. They need to leverage data and analytics in new ways to harness insights to tailor their experiences. Beyond this, we’ve noticed some sector-specific trends. The importance of citizen digital services has never been clearer than in recent times. Disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has shown how vital efficient and seamless digital infrastructure and interactions are to government. To achieve this, governments have to adopt a whole-of-government approach and to create a truly digital end-to-end experience for citizens. COVID-19 has also rapidly accelerated the technological demand of the healthcare sector. Solutions for minimising human contact in healthcare environments and tracing infections have played critical roles in the battle against the pandemic. But behind the scenes, we’re also seeing increasing utilisation and adoption of advanced analytics and data-driven care, where patient data can inform more efficient, more effective, and more personalised care. Technology’s role in defence and homeland security continues to grow at pace. And as new technologies such as AI and machine learning emerge, the contribution technology can make to safer communities will only grow. One notable trend is the increasing focus on the integration of advanced video analytics for surveillance and homeland security. Despite the pandemic bringing so much travel to a halt, we’ve also seen demand for and development of new innovations in the transport sector. We’re seeing the true advent of autonomous vehicles and the early signals of them moving into the mainstream, powered by 5G connectivity. But also, AI is playing its part to support drivers themselves, with increasingly intelligent navigation and driver-centric systems. In financial services, cyber security is a key priority for many organisations as threats become ever-more sophisticated. Many are using analytics to fight smart in the battle against scammers and monitoring transaction data to spot potentially fraudulent activity.  Reward and loyalty points systems have also been highlighted as a weak point for hackers, where stronger infrastructure is needed to protect businesses. Banks and other institutions are also increasingly looking to create new ways to securely share data to help combat fraud and money laundering. The telecommunications landscape has been changing dramatically and this is set to continue.  New revenue streams are arising with the rollout of 5G. The new applications and services possible with 5G will create whole new opportunities for network providers. There are many tech forecasts and predictions for the year ahead, but they all have something in common, or rather some things. There are 3 technologies that are driving almost all of these new trends — artificial intelligence, 5G, and the Cloud — and these all feed into one another.   There’s no doubt that artificial intelligence has gone from something lots of people were talking about and few were actioning, to something that’s in practical application across a whole host of sectors and use cases. As artificial intelligence continues to become a staple element in organisations’ technology mix, we’re seeing increasing demand for more strategic partnerships, where broader support is needed in utilising the full potential of data, analytics, and AI. 
 
The skills gap that has opened across the industry with the advent of AI means organisations are struggling to attract and retain talent with the diverse skillset and experience required at different stages of their journey.   In many ways, 5G is the magic ingredient that will make so many of the incoming innovations possible. With its ultra-low latency, significantly bigger bandwidth and faster speed, 5G’s impact on industries and businesses is hard to underestimate. On top of increased operational efficiency through automation or the ability to perform remote operations securely, whole new possibilities will come into view. 5G will also accelerate the adoption of edge computing, feeding into the trends of distributed and de-centralised applications.  We’re also seeing it accelerate Internet of Things (IOT) development and cloud adoption across enterprises, creating a tsunami of data that needs to be managed, but also driving demand for machine learning (ML) and advanced analytics solutions to turn all of this data into valuable insights. Overall, 5G is driving a real paradigm shift towards edge computing and distributed architecture which will have ripple effects across all industries and sectors. It’s igniting a fundamental change in data management, security and distributed applications, all big changes that organisations will need help to navigate.   The huge growth in data demands driven by Big Data, IoT, and now 5G devices and the hunger for pure computing power from advanced analytics, which can’t be met by traditional data centres, are all coming together to create the perfect storm for the Cloud. Together with the overall pace of digital transformation and changing macro environments, organisations are no longer able to forecast infra requirements way ahead for procurement. This agility can only be supported by the Cloud.   We’ve been reshaping our business and strategising to help meet these new demands and adapt to these trends. From introducing new specialised service organisations such as Gov+ and Telco+ to drive public sector and communications innovation, to instilling a whole new culture of talent development and creating a broader and stronger partner ecosystem. To answer this demand for innovation across the region, we’ve created our Innovation triangle, connecting Singapore, Melbourne, and Shenzhen to share talent and expertise across borders and drive progress in all markets. This model of co-creation and cross-pollination of ideas will help us lead the way into the future. Organisations are increasingly hyperconnected with their partners, their suppliers, their customers and other stakeholders, and NCS is no different. We’re building a hyper-connected partnership ecosystem with clients, tech partners, and industry players to fuel innovation and co-creation.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  In today’s digital world, most organisations have embraced the use of technology to deliver business value. From developing IT solutions’ perspective, there is a need to deliver these applications in the shortest possible time so that businesses can quickly reap the benefits of technology and get a head start over their competitors. To develop these applications, multiple groups have to work together. The development process involves the conceptualisation of the end product, building minimum viable product and finally through iterative process, to develop the product. To reduce the cost of development, organisations often adopt offshoring practices and product principles to guide and assist them in their review of the development.  Developers, product owners and other partners thus have to come together and collaborate across multiple geographical locations and time zones. For such a collaboration to deliver objectives within tight schedules, IT organisations will need to adopt standardised delivery processes and use efficient platform that will help accelerate the development.  Platforms play an important role in enabling collaborative development.  They provide a practical approach to address the challenges involved in development: In current circumstances, such platforms will be even more important as they provide secure collaborative environments for teams that may not be able to meet up physically, even though they may be in the same geographical location. Pre-built dashboards can help address the management challenges involved in a distributed development scenario where software may be developed in one country, hardware built in another, and testing carried out in a third. Such dashboards will enable teams to track work progress across the different locations and generate the relevant reports. For example, they can help project managers to monitor the progress across different development zones, while programme managers can monitor the overall programme status across different geographies. Effective dashboard provides: * Overall status of the programme 
* Status of specific projects and the development status 
* Ability to zoom into development activities within specific projects to look at sprint level  
     information 
* Ability to understand the status of user stories and the dependencies, and the impact to 
     project schedules Development platforms should have the capability to spin off development environments based on customer’s choice of cloud provider. Automated management of infrastructure includes provisioning, patch management, and hardening to customers’ specific standards and product requirements.    The use of tools in application development leads to quality outcomes because they enforce standardisation. Adoption of DevSecOps tools will pave the way for: * An effective and standardised branching strategy for the applications that are being developed 
* Automated deployment of codes to the provisioned environment 
* Effective tracking of deliverables and recording of issues that are reported 
* Gamification to introduce a competitive element into the developer community 
* Identification of code quality issues early in the development process 
* Secure coding by incorporating best practices in DAST, SAST, IAST With a project that is distributed and managed across multiple locations, the ability to understand project data and make timely management decision is of paramount importance. This will help avoid schedule and cost overruns. It is therefore important for the development platform to be smart. This means having the capability to get data from multiple touchpoints to enable * Effective work assignments 
* Timely escalation with information on corrective actions 
* Correlation of data points to provide insights into event dependencies and  possible alternatives 
* Identification of project risks using data points collected from the DevSecOps tools Development platforms provide a practical approach to addressing the challenges of distributed development and ensuring successful project delivery. They help ensure that projects are completed on time, whilst meeting the requirements of application quality and stability. This is achieved by supporting collaboration amongst stakeholders; ensuring standardisation through the use of tools; enabling rapid deployment of development environments with the capability to manage and monitor them; and increasing productivity through the adoption of tools, best practices and gamification.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  In today’s highly competitive retail industry, the importance of data in shaping decisions and strategies is paramount. NCS developed an advanced central repository for a luxury retailer to gather and analyse data from its China and Asia Pacific branches. The platform enabled the retailer to optimise its supply chain and enhance its overall business strategy. Through  , the retailer can make informed decisions, manage supply chains,  , plan targeted marketing programs, and boost customer satisfaction. Due to the data protection laws in China, personal identifiable information (PII) of customers cannot be transferred across borders. Hence, the luxury retailer maintained its own data reporting process for many years. However, this approach lacked consistency with other markets within its APAC branches, making it difficult to have a comprehensive view of customers data, inventory and insights from its APAC and China branches, which  are significant regional growth driver. NCS enhanced the data integration flow by incorporating hashing and transformation techniques. Additionally, the data warehouse was redesigned to ensure that China and the rest of the APAC region share a common schema. A presentation layer was added to the dashboards to facilitate data exploration and effective communication across the APAC region. This solution enables a single, unified view of customer data which can be accessed quickly and efficiently across the APAC region,   and enhancing analytics.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  MyTransport.SG Mobile is an all-in-one travel toolkit for motorists and commuters. The mobile app with location-sensing capabilities was introduced by the Land Transport Authority in 2010 to cater to the growing population of technology-savvy private and public transport users who demand user-friendly and timely information while on-the-go. Traditionally, transport information was limited to navigational systems that provided route details to help motorists and commuters get from point A to B. What was lacking was the availability of real-time transport information to complement the route details and help the public refine their travel plans. MyTransport.SG Mobile addresses this by utilising a two-way engagement approach to deliver an interactive and content-rich experience. The app simplifies the process of checking on traffic news, road conditions, the location of electronic road pricing (ERP) gantries, ERP rates, parking availability, public and premium bus services, MRT and LRT stations, taxi call numbers and even the latest bidding results for the Certificates of Entitlement. One of the new features of MyTransport.SG Mobile is the public transport Journey Planner, a handy, intuitive guide which helps commuters map out the shortest and most convenient route to their destination using buses or trains. Key functions include the counting down of bus stops and train stations to the destination; a pro-active alert when nearing the destination; and one-touch access to the user’s favourite bus stops and train stations. A 360-degree interactive street view display and common taxi booking numbers are also included. The new features ensure that even commuters who are unfamiliar with the public transport system can travel at ease, without worrying about missing their stops or travelling in the wrong direction.

The need for citizen-centric services Public-private partnerships: The catalyst to digital transformation Developing agile digital services explore more 
                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  In microbiology, the amoeba cell is able to sense environmental threats and opportunities, and form extensions of its cytoplasm, known as pseudopodia. These adaptable “false feet” help amoebas to move about and capture food, and can shape-shift or disappear altogether when needed. This fascinating versatility is what gives amoebas their survival advantage. In the same way, governments need to undergo digital transformation in order to keep up with the increasingly complex challenges that are posed to them today. Andy Sim, Transformation Director at NCS Government Strategic Business Group, explains the need for transformation to be centred around citizen-centric technology. Besides that, he also shares how open data sharing and public-private partnerships are key to this transformation. The government can draw lessons from the private sector and cater to citizens better by thinking of them as customers, Sim says. When governments have a deep understanding of citizens’ needs and aspirations, they can design more citizen-centric services. Even though technology can be a good enabler of change, managers need to integrate it with people and cultures to achieve its intended outcomes. “The citizen journey should be anchored in what the user thinks about the experience, rather than in how the government agencies work,” he says. To counter this inertia, Sim believes a major mindset shift needs to be involved. Governments need to develop societal solutions with external collaborations, rather than solve problems only from the inside, he says. For example, NCS collaborated with the Singapore Prison Service (SPS) to create a Prison Operations and Rehabilitation System. Prison inmates are influenced by a variety of social or environmental factors which may cause them to re-offend. NCS has created a data-driven system to support prison operations with real-time inmate information. With this system, SPS can better manage its operations and track the inmates’ risk patterns, rehabilitation and behavioural progress, leveraging an evidence-based approach to tailor intervention efforts according to the needs of the inmates. Sim believes that government agencies need to overcome the “silo mentality” – the reluctance to share information and ideas – in order to promote collaboration and innovation. This requires a “fundamental culture shift”, wherein data sharing should be seen as a necessity rather than a bonus. A trust-based mechanism needs to be established so that this can happen, he further adds. At this year’s Smart Nation and Digital Government Industry in June 2022, GovTech’s Chief Executive, Kok Ping Soon announced the agency’s commitment to deepening industry partnerships between the public and private sectors. To facilitate such collaborations, the Singapore government has set up a centralised   for private developers to co-develop solutions with government developers. Increasingly, technology has opened up opportunities for public-private partnerships to help promote this culture shift towards open collaboration and innovation. Case in point, NCS has helped a nation’s government develop an open innovation platform to aid the work of developers, researchers, and journey planners in the transport sector. The platform provides developers with a variety of datasets and interfaces which allow apps to “talk” to each other. Developers have used this platform to create third-party transport applications. These applications help citizens navigate their transport options around the city, bringing greater convenience to the lives of citizens. Similarly, cross-ministry data sharing in Malaysia has allowed the government to record which of its Halal products are the most popular internationally,  . These insights helped smoothen trade processes and boost the state’s economy. Globally disruptive events such as the Covid-19 pandemic have spotlighted the need for agility in governments’ digital services. This is where data sharing plays a crucial role in accelerating the innovation process. During the pandemic, governments needed to develop solutions quickly when faced with the challenge of managing a rapidly changing outbreak. For instance, Singapore’s Ministry of Manpower (MOM) had to manage an outbreak among hundreds of thousands of migrant workers living in dormitories islandwide. NCS helped by speedily developing a user-friendly digital programme to monitor migrant workers’ health, provide them with prompt medical advice, and help MOM optimise the deployment of its medical teams, shares Sim. This agility would not be possible without the adoption of a composable service approach, he says. Composability is a design principle which allows for older systems to be easily reassembled for the needs of today. A highly composable system would have building blocks which can be adjusted easily, depending on what users presently need. Composable design can also help governments migrate smoothly out of their existing IT infrastructures, onto public cloud platforms – an important first step in developing agility in citizen digital services, shares Sim. “Adopting a composable service approach enables governments to extend the reuse of capabilities as much as possible,” he says. With these lessons in mind, governments will undoubtedly find a citizen-centric approach when creating public services. Coupled with a versatile attitude towards public-private partnership, this is sure to deliver a kaleidoscope of positive outcomes for the citizen experience.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  Commercial enterprises have long been attuned to the importance of providing a great customer experience. Now governments too, are increasingly recognising that they need to put citizen experience at the heart of their dealings with the public. This is especially true in light of the Covid-19 pandemic, which highlighted just how crucial government services are in the lives of citizens while also drawing attention to things that can be improved in the way government agencies around the world engage with the public.  Getting the customer experience right means acknowledging that the behaviours and expectations of citizens have changed. Today’s citizens tend to be fairly tech-savvy and they are increasingly comfortable with the presence of technology in nearly all areas of life. We can see this in the widespread use of track-and-trace technology during the pandemic and the phenomenal growth of the e-commerce sector over the past few years, for example. In 2014 global  totalled USD1.3 trillion; by 2021 it was approximately USD 5 trillion. The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) estimates that 63 percent of the world’s population used the Internet in 2021. With people spending more time at home due to the pandemic, the Internet has become indispensable in many areas of life — people have come to rely on it for everything from accessing government services to consuming media to receiving health updates to buying groceries to conducting bank business and more. Social media use is also on the rise. There are around 4.6 billion  in the world today, ten percent more than a year ago and three times more than a decade ago, and there is a dizzying variety of platforms for users to choose from. Not surprisingly then, many people now expect government agencies to provide high-quality digital services. According to , a report released by Salesforce and BCG, 76 percent of people believe that online government services should be on a par with or better than those offered by the best private sector organisations, including 32 percent who believe they should match those offered by the likes of Amazon, Google or Facebook. Government agencies need to ensure that their digital services are easy to use, hyper-relevant, secure, and easily accessible. This will be beneficial for both citizens and the governments that serve them — citizens will be able to enjoy better health and financial security, among other things, while governments will be able to improve efficiency and earn the trust of citizens. There is certainly room for improvement in government services. The survey conducted by Salesforce and BCG found that 64 percent of Singaporeans encountered one or more problems during their most recent digital interaction with the government, just short of the global average in 2020 (70 percent). Common problems cited by survey respondents around the globe included technical difficulties (20 percent of respondents), time-consuming or difficult processes (21 percent), and a lack of help (16 percent).  Improving the citizen experience begins with understanding citizens and the issues that affect them. To do this, governments will need to gather data, which means overcoming citizens’ concerns on privacy. Fortunately, around half of the people surveyed by Salesforce and BCG said they would be willing to share data with the government if it meant that they would get some benefit in return, such as greater convenience, or if the community stood to benefit. Government agencies in Singapore already have a large repository of data at their fingertips thanks to the Smart Nation initiative. Under the initiative, numerous data sets collected by public agencies operating in a range of sectors have been made publicly available on data.gov.sg. The data include things like school and kindergarten enrolments, hospital admissions, property prices, mobile data usage, energy consumption, public transport ridership, and more. By analysing this data, agencies can predict citizens’ needs and develop useful and user-friendly digital solutions or partner with appropriate solution providers. Singapore’s public sector has already notched up some success in this area. Notable examples include:   There are numerous tools which governments can use to gather and analyse data, including machine learning (ML) and other forms of artificial intelligence (AI), sensors, video surveillance systems, and more. In Singapore, the Housing and Development Board (HDB) has launched the Smart-Enabled Home Initiative which involves using data collected from sensors to optimise energy efficiency in homes and provide a range of smart home features. One notable NCS contribution in this area is the  , which collects data from sensors embedded in HDB estates and generate insights for HDB. These insights can be used to optimise the use of resources like energy and water and minimise service disruptions.  Public institutions in other countries have launched similar initiatives: in Hanoi, authorities have partnered with Siemens to install an  system which makes use of video analytics; in Los Angeles, AI is being used to ; and in Belgium, Nokia Scene Analytics, which uses ML to monitor video and audio feeds and sensor information to flag incidents in real time, has been deployed at various sites across the country to increase security. However, many citizens are concerned about the implications of governments amassing all this data. It could be seen as an encroachment on the privacy of citizens and there is the potential for governments to use the data to curtail citizens’ freedom. Government agencies should address these concerns by being transparent about what data they are collecting and clearly communicating to the public the reasons for collecting it. Wherever possible, data should be anonymised, and citizens should be given the ability to manage consent. Fortunately for public institutions in Singapore,  is high. The challenge, as the government goes digital, will be ensuring that this continues to be the case.   Digitalising government services is a major undertaking which requires careful planning. Public institutions embarking on the digitalisation journey would do well to use the Singaporean government’s  as a guide. As part of the Smart Nation initiative, the blueprint lays out a vision for a government that is “digital to the core and serves with heart.” This involves transforming businesses end-to-end, including policy development and planning, operations management, and service delivery. To achieve this aim, NCS is working closely with governments to: The opportunity to harness technologies and deliver citizen services for a fairer future has never been greater. With its wide spectrum of specialisations, NCS Gov+ can enable interoperable solutions and seamless services. These are just a few ways in which NCS Gov+ is partnering with governments, policy makers, and citizens in forging the digitalisation paths that advance our communities.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  Governments in Asia-Pacific are going all in on artificial intelligence (AI) and digital transformation. Singapore’s refreshed National AI Strategy aims to make the country a leader in developing AI solutions for the public good, while the Southeast Asian region is taking a proactive approach to nurturing AI solutions, reports  . Governments are adopting AI via established cloud service providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google, and Microsoft. This helps them access machine learning (ML), deep learning, and generative AI tools, as GovInsider  . Many governments are adopting a hybrid cloud strategy that allows them to adopt cutting-edge tools via the commercial cloud while keeping the most sensitive data within on-premises systems. NCS’ Practice Lead for Hybrid Cloud, Vicardo Ng, tells GovInsider how the company is working with clients to help them adopt AI safely via cloud-based platforms and the key considerations that need to be looked into for a safe and secure hybrid cloud strategy. Moving to the commercial cloud and tapping solutions can be a daunting task for government agencies, says Ng. This is why NCS recommends that agencies consider a hybrid cloud approach, where sensitive systems remain on the private cloud while less sensitive systems are migrated to the cloud, he adds. Agencies can embark on their AI journeys by working closely with cloud service providers, many of whom offer a range of AI development tools as well as foundation models, says Ng. He adds that government departments can use these models to create specific AI applications, while AI development tools can support them in creating specialised AI and ML workflows. For example, Singapore’s Ministry of Trade and Industry worked with Google Cloud tools to   that public officers can use to retrieve data, while GovTech Singapore worked with AWS tools to create   that agencies can tap on to automate ML workflows. Over the past six months, NCS has partnered with key cloud service providers, including   and  , as well as hardware provider  , to support public and private sector clients in accessing the latest AI technologies quickly. For example, the partnership with Microsoft will enable clients to tap on pre-built Microsoft solutions, including generative AI applications and cybersecurity tools. Clients can also tap on NCS’ digital services to co-create AI innovations on Microsoft tech. The partnership with Dell will also enable NCS clients to access generative AI solutions within on-premises environments, he adds. This will enable organisations to tap on AI even within more sensitive systems, explains Ng. NCS has also signed an agreement with AI Singapore, Singapore’s national AI programme, to co-develop generative AI technologies to drive innovation and strengthen Singapore’s position in the global AI landscape, according to a recent press release.   As agencies embark on their cloud migration journey, Ng highlights five key safety considerations: NCS offers cloud migration consultancy services for the Singapore government and has supported   in Asia-Pacific in redeveloping systems to run optimally and securely on the cloud, Ng adds. Education and upskilling of staff is crucial for organisations transitioning to cloud-based environments, he notes. Employees must be trained in the relevant skills to navigate the complexities of the cloud and uphold security best practices. The right training can help employees understand the unique security challenges associated with cloud migration, such as data protection, access management, and compliance requirements. “There will always be malicious actors seeking to infiltrate your systems,” says Ng and adds: “To protect against adverse events, we help clients to implement established security frameworks and therefore uphold digital trust.” As a technology partner for enterprise and public-sector clients, NCS seeks to ensure a smooth transition towards hybrid cloud and cloud-native end-states. “Together with our clients, we can make tomorrow safer by harnessing the power of technology such as AI to create a more secure and trusted digital future for all,” says Ng.    This article was first published by  .

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) supports millions of Singaporeans in their pursuit of skills mastery. Recognising the critical role of swift data access and insightful analytics in providing Singaporeans with the opportunities to develop their fullest potential throughout life, SSG embarked on a transformative partnership with NCS. Over a period of 12 months, NCS migrated the existing data environment and analytics platform from a constrained on-premises legacy system to a scalable cloud-based analytics solution. This allowed SSG to unlock significant cost savings and new potentials in data agility to support the evolving needs of Singaporeans in their upskilling and reskilling journeys. SSG envisioned a platform where data is highly tailored and democratised. This comprises of a platform that is highly accessible across departments, user-friendly, and adept at generating rapid insights to address a spectrum of business challenges. However, SSG’s system greatly restricted the creation of a democratised data analytics platform. Maintenance was cumbersome and inefficient with a system that struggled to scale alongside a growing user base. The diverse array of data ingestion scripts, each written in a different programming language, only compounded the complexity. NCS and SSG collaborated to transform SSG’s use of data within the organisation by adopting a more robust and efficient infrastructure on Government on Commercial Cloud (GCC2.0), integrating solutions from AWS, Talend and Tableau. The transition to a cloud-based analytics solution allowed SSG to quickly scale and adapt, ensuring that it remains at the forefront of supporting individuals’ upskilling and reskilling journeys. Confronted with the critical need for a data environment that is scalable, secure, and highly available, NCS migrated SSG’s on-premises data analytics environment and analytics models onto AWS GCC2.0. The move to cloud opened a myriad of possibilities for SSG. NCS also worked with SSG to strengthen data governance, improve data democracy, and enabled self-service data visualisation capabilities. The project was navigated with meticulous precision - working closely with the technical teams from AWS and GovTech to design the architecture, and developing a robust, multi-phased approach. It successfully translated to the completion of the migration and system enhancements within a period of 12-months.  To ensure users’ smooth transition and usage of the solution, the NCS team also developed comprehensive transition instructions, tailored training programs, and change management materials. This holistic approach not only facilitated immediate adoption, but also empowered SSG’s team to harness the full potential of the enhanced system from day one and beyond. Key highlights of the solution delivered to SSG: Migrating and transforming the then on-premises system onto GCC2.0 not only allowed SSG to democratise data to support their daily operations; it revolutionises the way data is harnessed and empowers SSG to foster an environment where data-driven decisions are the norm, not the exception.  The collaboration between SSG and NCS catalysed the creation of a data analytics environment that was not only exponentially faster but also more secure and robust, while at the fraction of the cost. Thus, enabling stakeholders to derive meaningful insights with unprecedented clarity and speed.  Share this article on: Thank you for your enquiry! We'll get back to you as soon we can.

                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  Australia’s technology sector is a key pillar of the country’s economy. According to the Tech Council of Australia (TCA), the sector contributed  to GDP in fiscal year 2021, equivalent to 8.5 percent.  Homegrown tech companies like business software developer Atlassian, fintech firm Afterpay, and digital advertising business REA Group are worth billions today. Moreover, the country is well prepared for technological changes. In the Economist Intelligence Unit’s , Australia tied for the number one spot with Singapore and Sweden. The ranking takes into account countries’ access to the internet, digital economy infrastructure, and openness to innovation. However, despite the sector’s healthy vital signs, tech workers are in short supply. Kate Pounder, the CEO of TCA, said in a statement that “There is still a stigma surrounding working in the tech space.”   In this article, we will be exploring some of the opportunities that are opening up in the tech space in Australia and how organisations can ensure that their employees have the right skill sets to take advantage of these opportunities in spite of heavy competition for tech talent.   According to  , “The combination of 5G, the cloud, and edge computing is a new paradigm that has the potential to change any and every industry it touches.” Use cases identified by Google include improving how products are manufactured, optimising supply chains, logistics, and customer experience, and reshaping transportation “through a connected infrastructure that may, finally, enable the future for autonomous vehicles.” Australia is well positioned to reap the benefits of these transformative technologies. The country is currently ranked 3rd in 5G-connected devices per capita, according to a   this year.  , meanwhile, forecasts that   will deliver a productivity gain of USD 10 billion in Australia’s healthcare sector by 2030, due to the potential for these applications to result in fewer and shorter hospital stays, streamlined doctor-patient interactions, drone-transported medical equipment and therapies, and improved experience and efficacy of telemedicine. The country’s manufacturing sector, meanwhile, stands to see a USD 2 billion productivity gain. The overall economic impact of 5G will be USD 20 billion in Australia by 2030, PWC says.  Cloud computing is also big business in Australia. BCG says that the   annually and is projected to be worth USD 11 billion by 2023. Moreover, AlphaBeta says that cloud architecture design will be one of the   in the country by 2025. Perhaps it is no surprise, then, that large tech companies like Google and Amazon have announced plans to expand investments in cloud infrastructure in Australia.  Tom Bernadou, Founder and Managing Director at Riley Solutions, an Australian cloud services provider acquired by NCS last year, says that “The cloud in itself is an exponential where it doubles your capability every few months. It kind of underpins the whole transfer and acceleration of technology.” He adds that “Clients tend to have a business outcome with cloud that requires an increased level of maturity in the way that they operate. Although they have got an ambition to solve big problems, their internal capability is one that's not quite there yet. So, what we (at NCS Riley) really see the opportunity to do is help those organizations improve their maturity around transformation. And then once they get to that point, they can then start to accelerate the way that they improve business, and so on.” To that end, NCS is currently building a   in Australia to help businesses accelerate complex cloud transformations. The centre will be launched in Victoria, which has the highest number of software development and cloud computing professionals on a per capita basis among Australia’s states. It will manage hybrid clouds on behalf of businesses, freeing them up to focus on creating better services, reaching new customers, and streamlining operations. In addition, it will help expedite innovation. Meanwhile, our Australian subsidiary, Eighty20 Solutions, is helping businesses save energy and lower emissions by switching from on-premises infrastructure hosting and storage to cloud-based solutions. This allows businesses to significantly reduce their environmental impact while cutting costs. Amazon Web Services said in 2015 that its customers use   and 84 percent less power by using its cloud instead of operating their own data centres, thereby reducing their carbon emissions by 88 percent. Moreover, Accenture says that “migrations to the public cloud can reduce CO2 emissions by   which equates to taking 22 million cars off the road.” John Kelly, the CEO and Co-Founder of Eighty20 Solutions, notes that sustainability is a key area of focus for organisations today. “It is a key metric we're now seeing within transformations,” he says. “While the green credentials of the cloud may have been a ‘nice to have’ in the past, they’re becoming a far more important consideration at the leadership table...And the C-suite sustainability agenda isn’t just about doing the right thing, it’s about delivering on important strategic goals that will enable companies to be more competitive, profitable and resilient.”   Advanced technologies are having a profound impact on how Australian retailers do business. Tools like artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are enabling these companies to gain a deeper, more holistic understanding of their customers and their preferences and create a more personalised customer experience. Bernadou notes that Riley has been working with retailers, particularly through their online channels, to help them improve merchandising or conversion for customers that are browsing their websites. “We do that through a combination of artificial intelligence and machine learning, and we essentially are able to offer highly personalised offers to customers as they land on our customers’ websites,” he says. By working on behalf of a large electronics retailer to create a more personalised customer experience, Riley was able to increase the retailer’s revenue three-fold. Bernadou foresees a future in which retailers exploit the opportunities of the metaverse to connect with people in new ways and offer richer customer experiences. Indeed, brands like Nike and Ferrari have already ventured into that sphere. Nikeland,  in which visitors can participate in games with their friends or try on virtual products, has had nearly 7 million visitors since its launch in November last year. Cloud solutions can also help retailers unlock additional business value. For example, Eighty20 helped a national supermarket chain improve scalability and reduce costs by moving workloads from on-premises hosting environments to the cloud. “By creating a synergy between the back office and frontline workers, we have supported organisations with their cloud transformation journey, allowing them to increase response times, providing the ability to pivot to change and deliver faster, thereby creating better brand and customer experiences,” Kelly says.   The role of the IT department has changed considerably in recent years. With organisations increasingly prioritising digital transformation, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic, the remit of IT teams has expanded to include things like the cloud and AI. As a result, competition for tech talent is at an all-time high.  The war for tech talent doesn’t just affect tech companies. According to  , “In 2019, before the Covid-19 pandemic disrupted hiring for most companies, at least temporarily, more than 40 percent of software engineer and developer hires were made by non-tech companies, up from about a third in 2010.” As Australia’s tech sector continues to grow, organisations will need to take a new approach to fostering, attracting, and retaining talent. Among other things, this involves investing in training and education. “Both Riley and NCS focus on offering not only the next generation, those that haven't really entered the workforce just yet, with the opportunities and ability to build their skill set and what this new world looks like, but also to find those that are looking to reinvent their careers, and give them the same opportunities to be able to rescale and leverage some of what the new world has to offer,” Bernadou says. Bernadou notes that this approach allows organisations to work with people who have different levels of life experience and who work in different professional fields. As a result, they are better able to solve some of the problems that come up than if they only focused on hiring young talent with strong digital skills but lower levels of life experience. It is also important for organisations to listen to their employees and take the time to understand their needs. John Kelly says that “We’re seeing a shift in what people value most, what really matters to them. The value chain is real and it starts with our people knowing they’re valued for their contribution now, with the flexibility to change and grow when they need to.” Employees at Eighty20 Solutions are able to confidentially voice their opinions, he says. No stranger to homegrown tech companies, Australia has exponential growth opportunities on the technological front, especially with the combination of 5G, the cloud, and edge computing. These technologies are transforming organisations’ backend operations and unlocking new business value by enabling more personalised customer experiences. As digital technologies become more prevalent in all industries, Australian organisations will need to ensure that they are   with the right digital skill sets. Those that fail to do so risk being left behind.    Riley Solutions, Founder and Managing Director Eighty20 Solutions, CEO and Co-founder Share this article on: Thank you for your enquiry!

                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  The Central Provident Fund Board (CPFB) is a key pillar of Singapore’s social security system helping Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents (“CPF members”) set aside funds to build a strong foundation for retirement. To enhance its service efficiency and responsiveness, CPFB partnered with NCS to implement a cloud-based solution that streamlined case management and improved citizen interactions. This upgrade has transformed CPFB’s service capabilities, providing CPF officers with a consolidated view of customer profiles and interactions across all touchpoints, while offering CPF members a more seamless experience. As a core institution to Singapore’s social security, service excellence and efficient citizen-government interactions are crucial to the Board’s mission to enable Singaporeans to have a secure retirement. Prior to July 2024, CPFB relied on 2 separate on-premise systems, i.e. Case Relationship Management (CRM) and Knowledge Management (KM) systems. This fragmented approach hindered the efficiency and delivery of exceptional customer service, so CPFB looked to a cloud solution that could consolidate their existing systems to elevate their interactions with customers and optimise their officers’ efficiency. With NCS’s extensive experience with CPFB’s systems, NCS embarked on a transformative project aimed at integrating various CPFB’s customer engagement channels and streamlining existing processes. Leveraging Salesforce Cloud solutions, NCS developed an integrated system to consolidate and enhance CPFB’s omni-channel capabilities, reinforcing their service philosophy to provide “Service that empowers, Trusted by all” with the ambition of delivering personalised case management at scale.  NCS worked with CPFB to implement Next-Gen Integrated Customer Engagement (NICE 2.0) - a platform serving as the foundation for CPFB’s omni-channel capabilities, with the ability to include future customer engagement channels and seamlessly integrate with other systems and applications within the Board and Whole-of-Government (WOG). The solution leveraged Salesforce and Amazon Web Services (AWS) under Government on Commercial Cloud (GCC) 2.0, consolidated the CRM and KM, and included an omni-channel portal. NCS also completed the data migration exercise, transferring more than 7 million customer records from CPFB’s systems to Salesforce. NCS finalised the cloud design and completed the cloud implementation in 11 months due to our familiarity with Government cloud requirements. This was a remarkable feat as it involved the largest & most complex Salesforce implementation in Singapore public sector to-date with direct citizen interaction and integration across multiple CPFB’s backend business systems and various WOG services.  NICE 2.0 also combines CRM and KM, allowing officers to leverage their internal and external FAQs to compose replies to customers and have the visibility of customer’s recently viewed FAQs. The portal also supports an online enquiry form that auto-prompts relevant FAQs based on customer’s selection and input in the form. This ensures that customer receive timely support round the clock even before they write in, and free up CPFB officers’ time for more complex account-specific enquiries. Overall, this collaboration with NCS has significantly strengthened CPFB’s ability to build and maintain robust customer relationships.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  NCS collaborated with the Manpower Research and Statistics Department (MRSD) and Information Systems and Technology Department (ISTD) from Ministry of Manpower (MOM) to implement a Progressive Workforce solution, anchored by the Labour Statistics Survey Portal (LSSP). The Occupational Employment Dataset and Progressive Wage Portal were developed to expand and enhance LSSP’s labour management capabilities. Adhering to stringent Government IM8 policy standards, NCS executed the full spectrum of activities, such as migrating data from legacy systems, establishing a new data repository, and commissioning a new portal to automate compliance checks and compensation benchmarks. The new and improved solution has equipped MOM with improved accessibility, efficiency, and data management capabilities, empowering both employers and employees. Additionally, it helps to facilitate more informed decision making and effective policy formulation. MRSD recognised the need to improve labour data management to ensure data-driven decision making and aid swift policy interventions, which requires addressing several challenges. This includes streamlining cumbersome manual data collection processes, establishing a centralised database to consolidate comprehensive employment data, improving compliance and regulatory monitoring to effectively implement the Progressive Wage Model, and expanding access to critical labour statistics and benchmarks. Addressing these issues were crucial for MOM to foster informed decision-making, enhance transparency, and ensure the efficacy of labour policies aimed at supporting Singapore's workforce and economic development.  To address these issues, MRSD implemented LSSP which aims to streamline data collection, simplify compliance oversight, and enhance data quality and accessibility.  The launch of LSSP represented a significant milestone in MRSD's commitment to leveraging technology for data-driven decision making and strategic workforce planning. The LSSP was created to modernise labour data management and policy implementation, paving the way for a data-driven approach to tackle today's labour challenges. Beyond enhancing survey creation capabilities, LSSP enables users to manage the entire survey lifecycle—from designing surveys and uploading sample data, to administrating and overseeing survey operations, to managing survey closure and downloading datasets. Government agencies and industry stakeholders benefit from LSSP's seamless integration, efficient data collection processes, and robust analytical capabilities, empowering them with actionable insights derived from reliable national labour market statistics. In response to the dynamic needs of Singapore's evolving labour market, MRSD embarked on several initiatives to further enrich LSSP’s functionality. Building on LSSP's foundations, two enhancements were introduced. Firstly, the Occupational Employment Dataset was established as a mandated registry to collect comprehensive data on current workers' occupational profiles and employment statuses. Secondly, the Progressive Wage Portal was implemented to allow employees to check if their employers are paying them fairly, based on the Progressive Wage Model and Local Qualifying Salary requirements. These two expansive upgrades enabled more informed policy decision making by providing insights into workforce demographics and career progression pathways. Together, these components form a comprehensive ecosystem with critical tools and insights to aid MOM in understanding the complexities of the labour market. Solution highlights include: The joint implementation of the Progressive Workforce solution by MRSD and NCS, anchored by LSSP, has notably advanced MOM’s capabilities to manage labour data more effectively, ensure compliance with regulatory standards, formulate data-driven policies, and enhance transparency and accessibility for both employers and employees. This comprehensive approach has streamlined labour data management, strengthened compliance with the Progressive Wage Model, and enabled more informed policymaking, ultimately leading to a more efficient and transparent system.

This not only alleviated the burden of maintaining physical data centres, but also allowed Singapore Customs to further improve regulatory operations and achieve cost savings. The innovations and improvements continue to solidify Singapore’s leading position in global trade. In an environment where digital agility and operational efficiency are essential to support highly dynamic customs regulatory operations, Singapore Customs encountered limitations with their on-premises legacy system. The legacy system had become increasingly inefficient to maintain and costly to operate. To empower operational efficiency and facilitate real-time insights, there was a critical need for Singapore Customs to evolve. The goal was to transition from a traditional, on-premises model to a modern, cloud-first approach leveraging on cloud-native technologies. Singapore Customs partnered with NCS on a journey to re-platform the existing on-premises infrastructure onto the Amazon Web Services Government on Commercial Cloud (AWS GCC 2.0). This empowered Singapore Customs to harness the power of cloud computing to innovate and deliver enhanced operational regulatory efficiency with greater speed and flexibility. Alongside NCS’ proven track record in executing large-scale migrations onto GCC, and our deep domain expertise from years of managing multiple systems for Singapore Customs, NCS was chosen as the partner for their cloud-first transformation journey. Keeping in mind the need for a secure and future-proof solution, NCS designed a tailored cloud-native migration and modernisation pathway that features cloud-native technologies on AWS for Singapore Customs’ regulatory operations. NCS also redeveloped the Singapore Customs Inventory Control System eServices to enhance traders’ experience. This project was one of the largest AWS GCC2.0 migrations in 2023. We re-platformed multiple applications with over 1 million lines of code and implemented over 30 sets of security controls to secure the systems. This was accomplished within the planned project timeline, without any schedule delays and major issues. Solution highlights include: The move towards a cloud-first approach for regulatory operations represented a significant leap in Singapore Customs’ ongoing commitment to embrace cutting-edge technologies to maintain Singapore’s prime position as a global trading hub. The collaboration between Singapore Customs and NCS has resulted in a more efficient and secure regulatory operations. Share this article on: Thank you for your enquiry!

                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) plays a critical role in responding to life-threatening emergencies round the clock, providing firefighting, rescue and emergency medical services to the community whenever they arise. The SCDF is always seeking ways to improve its life-saving operations through innovations and new programmes, and to this end, has partnered with NCS for a refresh on their community responder application, the myResponder app. This updated app will help empower, engage, and equip citizens to respond quickly to fire and cardiac arrest cases in their communities, improving on-the-ground response to such emergencies to save more lives. As the primary responder to all emergencies, the SCDF understands that speed is crucial in effectively managing incidents. One initiative aimed at bridging the gap between the onset of an emergency and the arrival of SCDF responders is the myResponder app. This mobile application enables users, known as "Community First Responders" (CFRs), to be alerted to and respond to nearby cardiac arrest cases and minor fires, thereby enhancing survival rates and minimising property damage prior to the arrival of SCDF paramedics and firefighters. It was reported in The Straits Times that from 2018 to 2022, CFRs had attended to 7,670 incidents – 4,525 cardiac arrest cases and 3,145 minor fires. Since the launch myResponder, at least 80 lives have been saved by CFRs who were alerted through the app. The importance of CFRs cannot be overstated, and to better their efficacy, SCDF looked to enhance the user experience and training resources available within the application. CFRs who are eager to respond may feel uncertain about their ability to handle emergencies effectively without undergoing training or a refresher. Additionally, while the app has maintained a dedicated user base over the years, increased engagement and updated resources could further empower CFRs in responding to cardiac and fire emergencies. With nearly a decade of operation, refreshing the app’s user interface (UI) will also ensure it remains intuitive and accessible for all users. Considering these challenges and opportunities at hand, NCS was tasked with modernising the myResponder app, leveraging their prior experience in catering to the force’s needs. This modernisation aims to enhance user engagement and provide comprehensive training resources, ensuring that CFRs are better equipped to respond effectively to emergencies. NCS and SCDF collaborated to launch the new myResponder, an enhanced version of the original app. This update includes redesign of the UI, introducing a refreshed dashboard and a comprehensive learning hub designed to boost user engagement in non-emergency situations. The learning hub provides CFRs with life-saving courses on responding to fire and cardiac arrest cases, empowering them to act confidently during emergencies. Additionally, the app provides a guided response process during emergencies, assisting CFRs to take the most effective actions during emergencies. A data, application and infrastructure migration to Amazon Web Services (AWS) under Government on Commercial Cloud (GCC) 2.0 was completed, where the application was redeveloped entirely on GCC 2.0 to tap on the AWS suite of services. Amazon ElastiCache allows data to be transmitted seamlessly in real-time between the mobile app, internet and SCDF’s console. Alert notifications are triggered to CFRs using Amazon SNS, while Amazon S3 serves as the database of storage and sanitation of all uploaded documents to the app. In addition, new integrations with SGSecure were made to complement the incoming reports from citizens to respond to.  For this implementation, NCS employed the DRIVE design thinking framework, our very own proprietary user-centred design methodology that prioritises client needs. Initial interviews were conducted with senior management and relevant stakeholders from SCDF to identify user requirements and explore opportunities for enhancement. This was followed by prototyping and design critique workshops with SCDF to co-create the desired experience. The solution was further validated through usability testing with members of the public and CFRs in a simulated emergency. This approach allows for comprehensive and robust evaluation of the app’s capabilities in real life. Key highlights of this solution: The refresh has breathed new life to the app, especially in non-emergency situations, increasing community preparedness and decreasing response times to emergencies in the community. With this new update to the myResponder App, SCDF can tap on a wider and more responsive network of CFRs to aid in life-saving, fostering stronger community relationships with users.

                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  Over the coming years, Telcos, System Integrators and Enterprises will be looking to capitalise on the maturing 5G network and invest heavily in infrastructure, technology, and applications. From exploring new use cases to refreshing traditional business models, we are witnessing transformation through 5G in almost every vertical. However, the path to profitability is not always clear to everyone. We examine several exciting monetisation opportunities key stakeholders can capitalise on with the advent of 5G. While 5G brings about major benefits to enterprises through enhanced speed, connectivity and latency, heterogeneous environment, new networking paradigms and novel use cases makes 5G vulnerable to new security threats. This has resulted in a growing number of attacks that enterprises all around the world face. These threats can lead to widespread distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, physical hardware hijacks and even complete shutdown of systems. *North American organisations Source:  This brings about the first key opportunity: End-to-End (E2E) security for enterprises. E2E security deals with aspects of authentication, integrity, key management, and confidentiality across the wide reach of 5G networks. This means that for E2E security to be effective, it should not only be flexible but scalable across the entire network to deliver mission-critical security. Besides technologies linked to 5G, other elements within the 5G network needs to be highly secure. 5G Threats will emerge across RAN, Core, MEC and DC and public cloud as well as within IT, OT, and across Telco and Cloud.  Therefore, E2E security must encompass endpoint security for various network slices, application, and device security, Radio Access Network (RAN) or telco security (provision of radio connections linking devices and endpoints to networks), 5G core network (including day-to-day operations and management elements) security, and Edge Cloud security. Figure 1. End-to-End security in enterprise on 5G network Source:  Various applications interact with the 5G network used for enterprise systems. Some examples of these applications include connected cars and smart grids. In such venues, it is critical to protect data privacy as well as the operation of each venue as threats to the system can compromise customer privacy and safety (i.e., attack on software and controlling multiple connected cars, shutting down grids supplying energy to cities). With the introduction of 5G and new technologies, enterprises will need to ramp up their E2E security and cover a broader attack surface. This presents a unique opportunity for security providers to provide comprehensive, exhaustive, and dynamic E2E security solutions for enterprise 5G and its applications. One trend we observe is the massive growth of IoT-linked devices. As a critical enabler of IoT, 5G enables faster speeds, greater capacity, and reliable connectivity to unlock the potential of IoT ecosystems and connected devices. On the other hand, devices employed by both enterprises and consumers are evolving to be smaller, smarter, and more personal. The convergence of IoT technologies and identity management could become the next key opportunity area of growth. Source:  Many devices we interact with today, from cars to handheld devices, are uniquely identified to access the network through international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI). While the purpose of doing so is for authorisation and access, over time the sheer volume and growth of “Things” with an identification grew to the point where it makes commercial sense to properly employ ID management. This creates an opportunity for players to step in and provide ID management for Things. In France, Orange S. A. has forged ahead and developed in-house identity platforms as part of a wider access management strategy ( ). This initiative is aimed at centralising and securing the data of millions of its customers. There are several compelling reasons why identity management is not only a lucrative opportunity but a strategic one in the 5G era. For one, maintaining up-to-date identities and access management are the most immediate use cases that scales marginally as more devices and connections are deployed. Digital identity management is the basis for secure data transfer and allows granular access control to manage and exchange data between resources, applications, and data owners. These form the foundation for personal customer engagement. Therefore, adopting the right identity management strategy will grow revenues through better customer service and longer customer lifetime value. 5G will reach far and wide and impact many sectors, especially those that manage large numbers of devices and applications (e.g., government, manufacturing, healthcare etc.). Hence, the ripening opportunity to rollout ID management of Things to provide stronger security and access management is critical in the scaling of IoT devices and digital identities. The 5G era will bring about ubiquitous high speeds, high data throughput and massive connectivity. With smarter devices, more details and data can be easily captured resulting in a data storm that leads to an impending data tsunami. Key technologies, such as AI, Cloud, and MEC are greatly enhanced by 5G. These technologies further perpetuate the rise in data traffic, forcing industries and their device ecosystems to evolve and capitalize on new opportunities. A plethora of opportunities driven by enhanced 5G connectivity such as improved automation, data monetisation, and edge compute, will experience massive growth. As industries and device ecosystems become ‘smarter’, connected applications and existing solutions will begin to evolve and capitalise on this surge of data traffic. This creates larger dependencies on data centres, virtual machines and MEC. Emergence of use cases such as connected buildings and smart girds also accelerates the production and availability of data. The data tsunami will make it impractical for humans to perform analysis efficiently. This creates another unique opportunity for players to capitalise on the production, collection, analysis, and management of big data utilising Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. This can take the form of building out scalable data architectures and analytic tools that can capture insights to make better decisions quicker. Several industries are set to benefit from the tsunami of data. In manufacturing, enterprises who have begun taking steps to innovate in line with Industry 4.0 will trial and implement a host of new use cases with the goal of increasing productive and efficiency. In one factory, automation helped a manufacturer reduce product rework rate from 25 to 15 percent by utilising data collected from production machines to prevent errors. This initiative is projected to save about EUR 27 million annually savings ( ). These innovations will inevitably cause a surge in data transfers and require strong underlying infrastructural support and scalable data architectures to be effective in transforming the industry. It seems that with greater connectivity and network speeds through 5G comes greater data usage and traffic. Therefore, we believe that the maturing of 5G and emergence of greater data transfers will create a massive opportunity for end-to-end data management. 5G enables many new technologies that in turn paves the way for the development of many new use cases. For enterprises, the quicker they are to adopt and go-to-market with newer technologies, the better position they would be to capture greater share of the market and hone a competitive edge. While it is not known if there will ever be a ‘killer application’ for 5G, the ability to enable a quicker pace of innovation could be of greater priority for enterprises now. Use cases and solutions can be developed faster by ‘mixing and matching’ from different solution components, akin to Lego blocks – where prefabricated solutions, like Lego, can be pre-built/pre-fixed and delivered more quickly. With pre-configured and prefabricated 5G industry-specific solutions, enterprises will be able to more easily deploy solutions that are both modular and scalable in nature. A central App Marketplace, like Singtel’s 5G Paragon, offers a suite of industrial applications orchestrated on a single platform to deliver powerful enterprise tools for different network slices ( ). Solutions such as these also reduce project start-up cost and therefore overall risk. As a result, enterprises can quickly deploy tried and tested 5G-enabled solutions that enables them quicker time-to-market rather than building solutions from with uncertain payoff. One thing is for sure, that the 5G era will enable broad transformations across technologies and processes in a quick time. To capitalise this growth, enterprises can better prepare themselves by prioritising quicker time-to-market and constant validation and curation of the most effective solutions that fit them. .

Imagining cities of people: resident-centred transportation Imagining cities of things: experience-centred transportation Are AVs and UAVs the future?   How can governments and enterprises plan? What’s needed hear what our thought leaders have to say about tech: explore the rest of the Future Trends 
                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  The world’s urban population has been growing rapidly over the past few decades. Today cities account for more than half of the global population and the United Nations expects that this proportion will rise to 68 percent by 2050. In Asia alone, more than 2 billion people currently live in urban areas. With urban migration showing no signs of slowing down, cities around the world are expanding fast. Moreover, suburban sprawl has ramped up during the Covid-19 pandemic as remote working has allowed workers to move away from city centres to more affordable and spacious residential areas. Suburban sprawl brings numerous challenges to city planners, not least of which is ensuring that people can move quickly and easily from their homes to their workplaces, commercial districts, amenities, and so on. Transportation infrastructure has the potential to shape cities both geographically and socially so it’s important to get it right. When designed well, transportation infrastructure can bring people and things closer together. It can also help to promote greater levels of pedestrianisation. For most cities  , if not the largest.   that it is also an area of focus for innovation and entrepreneurship — in the past few years the sector has seen the rise of ride-hailing and micromobility companies, autonomous driving pilots, and mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) platforms.) platforms. However, given the fact that new transportation projects usually involve the dispossession of land, it is important to strike a balance between efficient transportation and the overall public good. With this in mind, how do we plan urban transportation systems that give rise to the best possible outcomes for everyone involved?   Building    means considering the different demographics of the cities or towns these systems are intended to serve. Over the coming decades, one demographic in particular will place increasing demands on urban transportation infrastructure: senior citizens. A  of Singaporeans will be aged 65 or over by 2030, according to the Ministry of Health, and other cities around the world are similarly grappling with ageing populations. To ensure that residents can flourish well into old age, when driving or walking long distances is difficult, cities need to provide easily accessible high-quality public transportation that connects key amenities like healthcare centres and shops.     By contrast, younger people tend to travel further to get to work, socialise, and access amenities. For this demographic, tech-enabled MaaS has proved to be an effective urban transportation solution. Privatisation can help to drive innovation in this space, but it may not be the right approach for transportation as a whole. As BCG notes, private and public mobility stakeholders tend to have different goals. Private operators, seeking to maximise revenues, tend to put more vehicles on the roads while public ones usually aim to reduce the number of vehicles on the roads to ease congestion and cut down pollution.   The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the key driving forces currently shaping the future of the transportation sector. AI is increasingly being used within the sector to enhance the user experience. It can, for example, be used to find the best routes and optimal speed of travel, taking into account data on traffic conditions, road works, and other things. It is also being used by public and private organisations for things like asset management and monitoring traffic to boost road safety. Organisations are also using advanced data analytics to understand how transportation assets are being used and to make design improvements accordingly. For example, city planners can use advanced analytics to build infrastructure around well-worn paths, which sometimes diverge from planned ones. An experience-centric approach to transportation has also led to the concept of freeway removal which usually involves replacing freeways with parks, amenities, or residential buildings, often with the intention of making urban areas more pedestrian- and bicycle-friendly. In line with this concept, the government of Singapore has  to move some transportation infrastructure underground in order to “free up land for people-centric uses.”   Emerging technologies like autonomous vehicles (AVs) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs or drones) are expected to play a significant role in the urban mobility systems of the future. These technologies have the potential to unlock major  for cities, including reduced CO2 emissions and more efficient last-mile deliveries. Using drones to carry out airborne last-mile deliveries will reduce the need for diesel trucks, thereby cutting traffic congestion and pollution while slashing waiting times for customers from days to hours. According to a  on the future of last-mile deliveries, “automation has significant potential to increase efficiency. Autonomous delivery vehicles (ADVs) are and will be the dominant technology in this regard, and they have the power to reshuffle the entire industry.” The report also noted that technological developments in the last-mile delivery ecosystem are occurring at a faster pace than expected. However, we have some way to go before cities can start reaping the benefits of AVs and UAVs. Despite major advances in AV technology, fully autonomous driving is still not possible in busy urban environments. Moreover,  has so far not kept pace with the technological developments and there is still little consensus among lawmakers on how to regulate AVs due to ongoing safety concerns, questions over who is liable in the event of an accident involving a driverless vehicle, and the need to protect workers made redundant by AV technology.   There are a few things public and private institutions can do to plan for better urban mobility systems.

Collecting anonymised data on commuter travel patterns during peak hours can also help city planners ensure that transportation infrastructure is meeting the needs and expectations of people and organisations to the greatest possible extent. This could include, for example, monitoring road traffic with satellite technology and using the collected data to plan the construction, removal, widening, or narrowing of roads to ensure that traffic can flow as smoothly as possible. City governments can also use levy systems to incentivise or disincentivise certain modes of travel or transport routes.   Preparing for the future of urban transportation involves embracing new, cleaner sources of energy and modes of transport and ensuring that the right infrastructures and regulatory frameworks are in place to support new innovations in the urban mobility space, including: Ultimately, strong partnerships between private enterprises and governments will be key to unlocking the full potential of these innovations.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  Traditionally, museums have focused on preserving history and tradition, not just in their artworks and artefacts, but also in their communication with visitors. Institutions now face the challenge of engaging a growing generation of digital natives, and are looking at ways to provide innovative experiences to draw a wider and more diverse audience set towards art appreciation. To achieve this, NCS in partnership with National Gallery Singapore (NGS), developed the proof of concept “Beyond the Canvas: Raden Saleh's Forest Fire Immersive Experience” by tapping on the hardware capabilities of Meta Quest Pro, to bring static art pieces to life in a physical museum space. A key challenge identified was giving exhibits a broader appeal, especially to visitors who are beginners in art appreciation. While these visitors may be keen on learning more about the displays, written wall text alone may not be the most optimal in having the audience connect with the artwork. Some visitors may feel discouraged or excluded if they are not familiar with art, and assume that they must know art techniques and history before being able to understand the exhibits. There has to be a barrier-free way to experience, consume and appreciate the arts. With a holistic approach encompassing Customer Experience Strategy, Experience Design Behavioural Science, and on-site User Testing, NCS developed the “Beyond the Canvas: Raden Saleh's Forest Fire Immersive Experience” proof of concept that allows paintings to come alive for visitors to interact with the exhibits in new and surprising ways. The team comprises of designers, developers, product managers and UX/UI experts from the  ,   teams. Visitors will be able to don a   headset and interact with static paintings through hand gestures in an intuitive way. Their experience comes by way of the following technologies and features (please check the video to witness the full experience): : The successful testing of the “Beyond the Canvas: Raden Saleh's Forest Fire Immersive Experience” proof of concept paves a potential way forward for a more innovative and engaged museum visit among visitors of all backgrounds, from art connoisseurs to the general public. The development team conducted user testing among eight participants within the exhibition spaces. After interacting with the prototype, users were highly positive about the immersive experience and cited such novelty within museums as a strong pull factor— and their willingness to pay an additional entry fee to experience it. Overall, these users found that the experience increased their accessibility to the arts, felt an increased emotional connection to the exhibits and were appreciative of having a generative AI guide to answer their questions promptly. “Modern art can be a challenging topic for most of our general visitors. The potential for mixed reality to help them see beyond the canvas, may begin to unlock their curiosity and appreciation for art, by understanding the intricate stories behind them.” – Kevin Lim, Director, Innovation & Technology, National Gallery Singapore     Share this article on: Thank you for your enquiry!

Public safety public safety enforcement needs to evolve alongside the metaverse – but how? Contact Us Thank you for your interest. Training in the metaverse  Where 5G and robotics enter New tech, new risks 
                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  GovInsider sits down with experts from information, communications and technology (ICT) service provider, NCS, to find out how advancements in the metaverse, 5G, and robotics will be used to enhance public safety in the years to come.  In October 2022, at the 90th INTERPOL General Assembly in New Delhi, the first ever Metaverse specifically designed for law enforcement worldwide was unveiled.  Registered personnel are now able to tour a digital twin of the global police organisation’s headquarters in Lyon France from anywhere on earth, take immersive training courses in forensic investigation, and interact with other officers through their avatars.  As threats advance, so too does technology. The Homeland Security industry is embracing the metaverse, digital twins, robotics, and 5G connectivity to stay ahead of the curve.  Digital transformation leaders these days are looking to the gaming industry as the “gold standard” for virtual and extended reality applications in public safety, according to Leonardo Tan, Innovation Lead for Public Safety & Security Industry at NCS, a multinational information technology company.  For VR and AR developers to match up to the standards the gaming world has set, developers need a very strong understanding of a combination of emerging technologies in order to be able to simulate the real environment at high-fidelity.  “NCS is probably one of the first in the world to explore these emerging technologies for public safety, and we’re looking at a timeline of just one to two years to make them operational,” says Tan.  GovInsider speaks to the NCS team to find out just what we can expect in public safety enforcement tech in the near future.  The metaverse can help Homeland Security in two key ways: investigation and training, according to Elton Loh, Client Service Lead at NCS.  “We can use the metaverse to recreate a crime or incident scene, especially in cases where there were no witnesses present. By creating a playback of a very realistic environment, we can allow investigation officers to look at the various possibilities of what exactly happened,” says Loh.  For instance, metaverse simulations could be used to narrow down exactly where a sniper could be hiding in a building by recreating the trajectory of a bullet, Loh adds.  Police officers on the ground would just need to do a 3D scanning of the scene, allowing chief investigators that are not physically present at the scene to guide and advise investigations through the simulation.  Similarly for training, the metaverse helps to significantly reduce cost and safety risks by literally providing a whole room of possibilities in the virtual space. “These could include simulations of high-risk scenarios such as tactical driving, allowing them to first hone their skills and expect the unexpected in the virtual world,” Tan adds.  The INTERPOL has already kickstarted its virtual training programmes in their metaverse classrooms. In a live demonstration, the INTERPOL Capacity Building and Training Directorate immediately transported students to a virtual customs after delivering a course on passenger screening and travel document verification.  Public safety is no longer just a human endeavor – robots of all shapes and sizes have now joined the front lines.  For example, during the 2022 National Day Parade at Marina Bay, a fleet of drones, patrol robots, and stationed cameras were deployed for crowd control and monitoring, CNA previously reported.  “In the public safety environment, you need different robots to do different things across various terrains and use cases – but you want to have one single platform to control all these robots together,” says Loh.  The NCS robot manager helps organisations like the Singapore Police Force manage all of them collectively as a fleet, across different brands or interfaces, or control systems.  Together with the advancement of 5G infrastructures, the field of robotics can see even greater potentials with significantly lowered latencies. “Where robotics are concerned, we want systems that can react to and transmit information instantaneously – so low latency is very important, and 5G will be a game changer in this area,” says Loh.  As a subsidiary of Singtel group, NCS is at the forefront of beta testing new technologies alongside 5G rollouts and looking to transform the way Singapore’s Home Team Agencies operate.  
  As with the advent of anything new, however, these emerging technologies come with certain risks.  In an 2022 observatory report Europol Innovation Lab identified that the metaverse can potentially exacerbate identity theft, money laundering and scams, harassment, terrorism, and misinformation. Zero-trust models and blockchain technology will become critical to secure the future of the metaverse, GovInsider previously discussed.  “We need to understand the risks involved in order to be able to address them and gain public trust, as the metaverse is a new vector for criminals to operate, and it needs to be properly regulated” says Tan.   The challenge, Tan adds, arises from the unprecedented interoperability of different platforms. Especially for applications in the homeland security industry, an airtight environment is needed to deal with highly sensitive information, and secure authentication for involved parties is critical to the adoption of such technologies.  “We have to address this at the policy and legislation levels, and this means that authorities will need to understand the mechanisms behind these crimes,” says Tan.  Share this article on: Thank you for your enquiry!

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  NLB's vision goes beyond making information accessible - it's about bringing the richness of Singapore's cultural heritage right to the palm of your hand. In collaboration with the National Library Board (NLB) to support its LAB25 (Libraries and Archives Blueprint 2025)   role, NCS leveraged AWS services to create an interactive AR web app prototype, enabling citizens to discover the stories behind iconic landmarks anytime from their devices. This prototype lays the foundation for a more connected and curious Singapore, unlocking the secrets of our shared heritage in thrilling new ways.​ 
  NLB’s LAB25   efforts seek to nurture a stronger appreciation and understanding of the Singapore experience in four parts – gathering content about Singapore as a collector, leading digital preservation of this content as a keeper, enabling discovery and use of this by everyone as a connector, and inspiring generations of storytellers. NLB works closely with partners, such as NCS and AWS, to make Singapore content accessible and relevant, and weave it into other areas of learning. By enabling everyone to discover stories behind Singapore’s iconic landmarks, NLB hopes to inspire all to learn and appreciate the events that shape our national identity and collective experience. The NCS Cloud Innovation for Communities (CIC) team was tasked with making Singapore's rich history and heritage more appealing across all generations through engaging experiences powered by cutting-edge technologies. The vision was to create a 3D construct that cuts across space, time, and narrative to make Singapore's history come alive in a fun and educational way for everyone. Without an existing product in the market to meet their requirements, the CIC Program created an innovative and immersive AR web app that delivers content on demand, anytime, anywhere, with just a mobile/tablet over the internet – no need to go through the hassle of downloading another app. To gain deeper insights into what motivates Singaporeans to explore their history and culture, the CIC program employed a blend of the NCS DRIVE framework and the AWS Working Backwards methodology. These frameworks allowed us to discover and analyze user needs and goals and translate them into a clearly defined problem statement. By understanding the primary motivators for learning about our country's heritage, we were able to create a coherent end-user journey visualization and define the end vision for the solution. The entire process was executed with remarkable speed, moving from the initial concept to tangible results within the span of just one month. By merging NLB's extensive resources on Singapore's history and culture with the domain expertise and technological capabilities of NCS and AWS, the team successfully crafted a proof of concept. This prototype not only offered a glimpse into Singapore's vibrant history but also revitalised the storytelling experience, creating a more engaging and immersive encounter for Singaporeans. The POC for the web app was successfully built and tested within a month, with a focus on 5 of Singapore's most iconic landmarks located in the civic district. The app was able to recognize all five landmarks and display curated information about them, showcasing the fundamental features of the website and its potential impact. “The POC enabled NLB to test the concept of combining a geo-based platform and mixed reality to generate interest in Singapore heritage and history, where citizens can experience geo-based resources from our collections using the 3D framing of time, space, and narrative.” Soh Lin Li, Director of Partnerships, National Library Board. 
 
The prototype of the immersive web app experience was showcased to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat, and Minister for Communications and Information Josephine Teo. The project's use of technology was instrumental in enabling people to discover Singapore’s rich heritage and stories in an innovative way. Share this article on: Thank you for your enquiry!

                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  During the Covid-19 pandemic technology provided a lifeline to millions of people, enabling them to continue working, socialising, and accessing vital services even when their governments imposed major restrictions on movement. Among all the technological breakthroughs of the past few decades, one of the most significant is the development of artificial intelligence (AI). Recent advances in AI have supercharged information processing and brought advanced computing power into the mainstream. AI-enabled technologies have fundamentally transformed many areas of everyday life and as new breakthroughs are made the impact of these technologies on society will only increase. Some of the most useful applications of AI today include: However, the rise of AI has been met with concerns over the potential for it to perpetuate human biases or be misused for things like heavy-handed government surveillance. For societies to reap the benefits of technology while avoiding the pitfalls, organisations must learn to wield it responsibly. With that in mind, how can technology be used to bring governments and businesses closer to the individuals they serve without undermining trust?   As use of AI becomes more pervasive, many experts are raising concerns about the difficulty of defining and enforcing the ethical use of intelligent technologies. They point primarily to the fact that AI is increasingly being used by businesses which are mainly concerned with maximising profits and by governments seeking to surveil and control citizens, without sufficient transparency over the explainability, visibility or accountability to the individuals affected by AI-influenced decisions.  The issue is further complicated by the fact that two of the world’s largest tech superpowers, the USA and China, define ethics in different ways. This makes it difficult to achieve a global consensus on how to regulate AI and ensure that it is deployed in a responsible manner. According to  carried out by Pew Research Center and Elon University’s Imagining the Internet Center, most experts fear that “ethical principles focused primarily on the public good will not be employed in most AI systems by 2030.” Without a proper ethical framework in place to ensure the responsible use of AI, intelligent technologies could lead to a range of negative outcomes, including:   Discussions around the responsible use of AI have given rise to the concept of “human-centred AI”. Basically, this involves making human input integral to the design and development of AI systems to ensure that these systems improve peoples’ lives while operating with transparency and fairness and upholding privacy. NCS is doing its part to create a human-centred AI ecosystem. We help our clients to operationalise data and AI ethics by: We are an inaugural partner with the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) to test and provide input to refine the . The framework is designed to help organisations ensure that “decisions made by or with the assistance of AI are explainable, transparent and fair to consumers; and their AI solutions are human-centric.” NCS is continuing to find ways of harnessing the power of AI without undermining privacy. We are working to drive privacy-enhancing computation technologies that help uphold privacy, security, and transparency in the AI space, including: Shaowei Ying, Senior Partner and Chief Scientist at NCS, noted, for example, that it is possible to have an AI-powered surveillance system that preserves individuals’ privacy. “What we have been able to do is use summarised data for agent-based modelling, deriving individual-level insights from aggregated telco data without exposing the identity and privacy of individuals,” he said, “and we have found that the accuracy is actually good enough really for transport modelling and public safety use cases.”   There is no doubting the fact that AI will continue to become more advanced in the coming years as well as more ubiquitous in everyday life. It is important, therefore, to take steps now to ensure that the AI systems of the future operate in a way that benefits everyone in society. “The need for businesses to adopt ethical AI framework is clear: AI scales business operations, but it also unfortunately amplifies ethical risks,” Ying says. Wynthia Goh, Senior Partner, NEXT, NCS, agrees. “For AI to be trusted in society, people need to have assurance there are sufficient safety checks before AI applications are released and while they continue to be in use,” she says. “The bigger the impact an AI application can make, e.g. medical diagnosis of a critical condition or affirmation of a criminal act to law enforcement, the higher should be the bar that is set to make sure we have built an AI application that is fair. AI adoption is important to both society and the tech industry. We owe it to stakeholders as well as ourselves to get it right in terms of how we design, build, manage and monitor AI.” Ultimately, collaboration is key. As Ying points out, the AI ethical issue is “a multifaceted topic that requires technologists, humanists, and other functions within the organisation to address it. And only when all come together will we be able to solve that tricky, thorny problem.” There are reasons to be optimistic. According to Pew Research Center, there is a consensus building around ethical AI as the issue comes under increasing scrutiny. The think tank also pointed out that “no technology endures if it broadly delivers unfair or unwanted outcomes. The market and legal systems will drive out the worst AI systems.” NCS SG, Senior Partner, NEXT NCS SG, Senior Partner and Chief Scientist Share this article on: Thank you for your enquiry!

                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  The world’s urban population has exploded in the past few decades and continues to grow rapidly year by year. The United Nations (UN) estimates that  will live in cities by 2050. Increasingly, urban population growth is concentrated in the developing world. By 2050, nearly 90 percent of new urbanites will dwell in cities in Asia and Africa, according to the same UN report. This level of urbanisation brings major challenges from a sustainability point of view. Water shortages, air pollution, high levels of energy consumption, and poor waste management are just some of the problems associated with large cities. These things not only harm the environment and contribute to climate change, they are also detrimental to the health and general wellbeing of city dwellers. Making cities more sustainable should therefore be a top priority for governments and urban planners around the world. This requires a smarter approach to city planning and a willingness to embrace and leverage new technological innovations.   There are a number of things cities can do to improve the quality of life of all residents while ensuring a more sustainable future. Let’s look at five key areas of focus as well as some real-world examples of how cities are meeting the complex needs of their growing populations while mitigating the environmental impact of urbanisation. The communities in this article – their leaders, public officials, administrators, businesses, and universities – have taken extraordinary steps to render the urban environment more inclusive, equitable, agile, open to new ideas and, ultimately, resilient.   According to an India-based urban planning and development think tank, a study of 50 cities around the world found that “  of growth in energy consumption is directly related to urban sprawl, surpassing the impact of GDP and population growth.” Thus, minimising urban sprawl is essential to building a more sustainable future. This can be achieved by focusing on compact, well-connected mixed-use developments. To that end, city planners should look for ways to get the most out of urban spaces, such as: A number of governments around the world are already using digital twins, which are essentially virtual representations of objects, systems, or places based on real-world data, to enhance urban planning. For example, the government of the state of Victoria in Australia announced last year that it will spend nearly AUD35 million to build a  which planners, engineers, and builders will be able to use to model and test different scenarios before making major investments in urban development.  has also chosen to use 3D visualisation. According to Dassault Systèmes, the company tasked with building the model, it will “facilitate remote data sharing in order to simulate, plan and manage the city in a transversal and collaborative way, to develop effective public policies.” Singapore is another city which has taken this approach. A digital twin is being used to plan , a new 50-hectare smart mixed-use district being developed in the north-east region of the city.   A transportation network that allows the efficient movement of people and goods between districts is fundamental to any well-functioning city. However, the transportation systems in many cities are overburdened, which means poor air quality, long travel times, and costly journeys.  Urban planners need to rethink transportation in order to reduce its environmental impact and improve the quality of life of all city dwellers. This entails, among other things: NCS is working with MSI Global Private Limited, a subsidiary of the Land Transport Authority (LTA), to provide   that harness technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), automation, mobility as a service (MaaS), cellular vehicle-to-everything (CV2X) connectivity, and advanced analytics. The goal is to help digitalise the land transport industry and improve commuter experience and engagement. Moreover, our subsidiary DataSpark processes large geospatial temporal mobility data to provide intelligence on people and places which can be used to improve transportation infrastructure planning. Another example of intelligent transportation management comes from Japan. Toyota has implemented an Intelligent Transport System (ITS) Smart Pole to reduce traffic accidents in Toyota City. The pole is installed at a complicated road junction and uses cameras and sensors to monitor the movements of vehicles and pedestrians in the vicinity. An LED signboard displays alerts to those approaching the junction without right of way.    Cities account for  of global energy consumption and more than 60 percent of greenhouse gas emissions despite covering less than two percent of the earth’s surface, according to UN Habitat. Cities are therefore on the front line of the fight against climate change and should be doing everything possible to reduce the use of energy generated from fossil fuels. Some solutions currently being implemented in cities around the world include: Singapore is investing heavily in renewables like solar energy. The city achieved its  of 350 megawatt-peak (MWp) in the first quarter of that year. It plans to add at least two gigawatt-peak (GWp) of solar panels by 2030 and at least 200 megawatts of energy storage beyond 2025. Given Singapore’s high population density and lack of space, the city has been pushing the development of innovative solar solutions that are suited to urban environments in addition to more conventional solutions like rooftop solar panels. Examples include building facades that can generate power from the sun, movable solar power systems, and floating solar power plants. Meanwhile, NCS is helping drive the Housing & Development Board’s (HDB) sustainability and community development efforts through Smart Hub, which collects data from sensors connected to things like solar panels, lights, smart water pumps, and lifts in residential estates and monitors the data for anomalies. The data is used to assess and maintain the effectiveness of these assets and identify energy consumption patterns to improve energy efficiency.   One of the biggest challenges for cities is ensuring that crucial services like healthcare, education, and public safety are available to everyone even as the population expands.  Cities need to digitalise these services as much as possible to ensure that they are accessible and user-friendly for all, including the elderly, people with disabilities, and other vulnerable individuals. Increasingly, technology is being used to make education in urban areas more inclusive. For example, schools are installing high-speed internet connections and embracing remote learning tools. Meanwhile, healthcare is being democratised by telemedicine services which allow healthcare practitioners to diagnose and treat patients and share expertise with colleagues remotely. Thanks to advances in robotics and other technologies, it will soon even be possible for surgeons to operate on patients without being in the same physical location. AI is also playing a larger role in healthcare, ensuring that some aspects of care can be automated. For example, NCS has developed an AI-powered fall prevention solution. The solution is based on the Edge Intelligence Video-Based Analytic Camera, an edge device developed by NCS CorpLabs, which monitors a patient’s movements and alerts healthcare professionals when the probability of the patient falling is more than 95 percent.   Sustainable healthcare also involves ensuring that elderly, disabled, or infirm individuals can live in their own homes with a minimal amount of professional care. Fukuoka in Japan, for instance, has implemented a system for looking after its ageing population which involves the Internet of Things (IoT) and local communities. Under the system, local service providers like electricians and postal workers check on elderly residents in their homes on a daily basis assisted by “CareTech” solutions which leverage various technologies to monitor seniors.    Cities need to be able to respond quickly to public emergencies like natural disasters, especially those located in areas that are prone to earthquakes or extreme weather. They also need to be prepared for things like civil unrest, acts of terrorism, and cyber-attacks, all of which can have knock-on environmental impacts since they may cause funds to be diverted away from important sustainability initiatives. There is a range of solutions cities can adopt to boost preparedness for these kinds of events, including: Technologies like virtual reality (VR) are being used by some cities to simulate disasters and prepare response strategies. In Singapore, for example, VR is being used to provide  to emergency medical responders. Cities can use the IoT and tools like predictive analytics to monitor tremors and other natural hazards in real time and trigger evacuation warnings automatically. Indonesia’s , for example, provides real-time flood mapping in Jakarta using data from multiple open-source sensors as well as information crowd-sourced from social media.   New and emerging technologies are radically reshaping the way we plan and manage urban environments. It is essential that cities tap the full potential of these technologies if they are to remain liveable for future generations. This is a challenge that can only be properly addressed if local communities and private and public sector entities, including policymakers, city planners, technologists, environmentalists, and corporations, come together to share their concerns, exchange information and ideas, and work towards making urban development more sustainable and inclusive.

Innovating customer support: NCS’s generative AI enhancements for the Singapore Ministry of Manpower’s contact center innovating customer support:   generative   enhancements for the Singapore Ministry of Manpower’s contact centre Contact Us Thank you for your interest. Introduction Customer Challenge Solution Overview Conclusion 
                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  Generative AI is a fast-evolving technology that can deliver many transformational benefits to businesses and organisations. It can help to reinvent customer experiences, increase employee productivity and optimise business processes. However, one of the challenges faced by many organisations when adopting generative AI is that they have existing infrastructure that may not be easily upgraded with generative AI capabilities. Upgrading often requires substantial additional investment, significant implementation effort and long time-to-value. In this post, we describe how NCS used AWS cloud services complemented with ins8.ai, NCS’ hyperlocal speech recognition solution, to add generative AI features to the Singapore Ministry of Manpower's Contact Centre. The use of generative AI capabilities has helped to unlock benefits to streamline Contact Centre operations and improve customer experiences. The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) Contact Centre is a key touchpoint for the businesses, human resource professionals, employees and the general public as it manages queries on manpower and employment related issues. The queries received from the customers can be multi-faceted or cross-cutting. Addressing such queries with precision requires the agents to possess a deep understanding of the subject matter and ability to analyse the needs of the customer. When determining the needs of the customer, the agents would reference past records from the caller and documents from internal systems to determine suitable advice. Referencing multiple information sources would sometimes stretch out the duration of the call. After-call work, which includes call summarisation and other documentation, impacts the total amount of time taken by agents to handle each call, especially for complex cases. To help MOM’s Contact Centre reap the benefits of generative AI, NCS developed an approach to augment the Contact Centre with generative AI features that addresses the challenges without the need for an expensive rip and replace strategy. As illustrated in the architecture diagram below, new modules were developed to augment and integrate with the existing Contact Centre solution. When engaging callers on complex queries, agents need to have in-depth understanding of the relevant subject matter to provide accurate advice and good customer experience. Onboarding new agents to the level required for the job requires a considerable amount of time and resources to train them well. NCS pioneered the use of an onboarding chatbot, which accelerates the onboarding process while complementing trainer effort.  Agents can use the Chatbot to assist them in looking up answers to complex customer queries during training. The GenAssist Onboarding Chatbot is implemented using the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach with LangChain, Amazon Kendra and Anthropic’s Claude Instant model in Amazon Bedrock. Internal knowledge documents are stored in Amazon Simple Storage Service and indexed by Amazon Kendra. The solution is able to generate responses to complex queries within seconds with an accuracy of 93%. Conversation audio for each call between the caller and Contact Centre agent is captured by the GenAssist audio service. Callers often use colloquial accents in their conversations with Contact Centre agents, which can be challenging for most commercial speech-to-text products to transcribe accurately. Ins8.ai is NCS’ hyperlocal speech recognition engine that performs hyperlocal voice transcription at scale with high accuracy.  The audio service sends the audio stream to ins8.ai to transcribe call conversations in real-time with 95% accuracy. The Summariser Service retrieves the call transcript from ins8.ai, preprocesses it and sends it together with an optimised prompt to the Large Language Model (LLM) hosted on Amazon Bedrock to perform the summarisation task. In this case, Anthropic’s Claude Instant model was selected as it strikes the balance between speed, accuracy, and cost-effectiveness. While there are many available Large Language Model (LLM) evaluation metrics, different evaluation metrics have different advantages and limitations. For the first release, NCS used a human-in-the-loop approach to evaluate the generated summary. Using this approach, the Claude Instant model achieved a 99% accuracy score. NCS continues to research the most suitable text summarisation evaluation metric so that this process can be automated in the future. The Contact Centre agent uses the GenAssist Summariser plugin in the Agent Desktop Client to retrieve the generated summary, review it for accuracy, and make necessary edits if required before logging the summary into the CRM system. With the generative AI powered summarisation tool, agents can now perform this task twice as fast. To ensure data protection and privacy, Amazon Bedrock neither stores nor logs customers’ prompts and completions. Furthermore, Amazon Bedrock does not use customers’ prompts and completions to train any AWS models or distribute them to third parties. Model providers also do not have access to Amazon Bedrock logs or to customers’ prompts and completions. With the new generative AI enabled Contact Centre, MOM achieved key improvements across various critical metrics of the Contact Centre. The average call handing time (AHT) was reduced by 12%. The average after-call-work (ACW) was reduced by more than 50%. Harnessing the AI tools to streamline the tasks of agents simplified their responsibilities and empowered the agents to fully focus on connecting with each caller, fostering a deeper understanding of their concerns and alleviating anxiety while effectively resolving queries. This change has also cultivated a more positive work environment and contributed to heightened job satisfaction among Contact Centre agents, along with an improvement in overall productivity of 6%. NCS is looking at further improving the solution with roadmap features. For example, using real-time transcription to detect and proactively push context-relevant information and content to the agent in real-time that can help to reduce call handling time. Generative AI is a fast-moving technology that brings new advancements at a rapid pace. It holds a lot of promise but is also capable of delivering real-world business benefits today. In this post, NCS has shown that with some creativity in augmenting existing infrastructure with new capabilities, enterprises and businesses can already take advantage of generative AI to help enhance customer experiences, increase employee’s productivity and optimise business processes without a costly infrastructure overhaul. If you are looking to modernise your Contact Centre with generative AI capabilities, NCS has extensive experience providing consulting, integration, as well as managed service desk and Contact Centre services.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  Throughout the course of human history, work — and by extension, the workplace — has been central to how human beings organise and collaborate to create shared value and shape societal development. The 2020-2022 pandemic years highlighted the critical role of immersive technologies in ensuring operational continuity in workplaces where physical presence was limited or not possible. For example, AR/VR technologies enabled innovative solutions for remote training, helping to bridge knowledge gaps in industrial workplaces and smart manufacturing processes by providing training to unskilled or temporary workers to perform complex maintenance operations. One industry that is ripe for immersive tech is healthcare, and studies have shown training in AR/VR can improve knowledge retention 2-3x more than traditional learning methods. Training in VR can also be less expensive compared with reserving an actual operating room and using actual tools and equipment as well as medicines and materials. Johns Hopkins in the United States made medical headlines for using AR in the operating room. Surgeons used AR headsets to perform back surgeries on a living patient. The headsets projected images on the see-through display showing the patient's bones, muscles, and connective tissue from CT scans. The technology brought important and relevant information to the surgeons as needed, and it kept surgeons engaged with the patient throughout the surgery. Many industries are teeming with opportunities for AR/VR and other advanced technologies to maximise their employees' contribution to the digital economy. Technologies such as AI-enabled digital assistance, enterprise-wide intelligent automation and integration, feature-rich, and interactive immersive environments promise to amplify the potential of tomorrow’s digital enterprises by revolutionising the workplace and the way we work. This article is part of a series of co-written articles with IDC.

                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  In the ever-evolving landscape of technology, where innovation drives the competitive edge, the role of software development has never been more pivotal. Today, we find ourselves at the intersection of ambition and execution, where harnessing the potential of software innovation is a strategic imperative. The question we now face is not whether to embrace AI, but how to wield it as a catalyst for organisational growth. In this white paper, we shall embark on a journey into the realm of AI-assisted programming and how it revolutionises software development. The demand for innovation and efficiency in software development has never been greater. Where most industries depend on software as the linchpin of their operations, AI-assisted programming stands as the harbinger of transformation. At its heart, it involves the integration of advanced AI, epitomised by tools like  , into the software development lifecycle. In the pages that follow, we will explore the ways in which the triple A benefits of  —can manifest both horizontally and vertically. We will delve into how we can usher in a new era of software development through three key value drivers, namely development acceleration, code protection, and developer empowerment. You will gain insights into how AI-assisted programming is crucial in helping companies to maintain a competitive edge. Traditional software development workflows frequently suffer from inefficiencies and bottlenecks, which have a negative impact on project timeframes and results. These workflows are riddled with repetitive coding tasks that drain valuable time, debugging processes that typically catch errors late in the game, and lengthy development cycles that can stifle adaptability to changing market conditions. This section highlights the pressing need for innovation in the software development landscape and sets the stage for examining how AI-assisted programming offers a game-changing remedy to these age-old problems, ushering in an era of unparalleled productivity. AI-assisted programming follows the shift in preference towards agile methodologies – working quickly to make small iterations and get ongoing feedback. Through real-time code suggestions and auto-completion features, these tools simplify the coding process, drastically reducing the need for manual searching and typing. They also assist in the generation of code snippets, the automation of routine coding activities, and the construction of boilerplate code. As such, companies can speed up the software development lifecycle and enable quicker time-to-market in stages such as initiation (code refactoring), requirement & design (user stories generation), construction (code generation), and testing (automated unit test scripts). This automation not only accelerates coding but also improves code quality by minimising syntax errors and ensuring best practices are followed. For example, in the case of automated unit test script generation – AI tools like  and  can analyse the code being developed and provide code suggestions for test cases. It identifies different scenarios and edge cases that should be tested, generating test cases for various input values, corner cases, and boundary conditions. By proactively detecting errors, vulnerabilities, and bugs in real-time, developers reduce the need for debugging efforts later in the development cycle. In a  trial conducted to evaluate the impact of AI on developer productivity, it was revealed that participants with access to the AI pair programmer completed the given task  than the control group . Naturally, the productivity gain would imply a significant amount of cost savings – cost savings in project management that arises from shorter development cycles, and cost reductions associated with bug fixing and maintenance, thereby allowing companies to enjoy significant cost reductions. The dependence on software applications has reached unprecedented heights as technology is increasingly incorporated into every aspect of our life. As a result, the effects of software flaws, hacks, and poor-quality code have increased tremendously. These problems not only pose serious risks to the confidentiality and integrity of data but also have far-reaching repercussions for an organisation’s standing in the public eye, financial security, and legal standing. To navigate this complex and high-stakes terrain, organisations should start recognising the potential of AI-assisted programming in fundamentally altering how code quality and security are maintained throughout the software development lifecycle. In this section, we will delve into the transformative role of AI in ensuring robust code quality and security, safeguarding against potential vulnerabilities, and fortifying the software that underpins our digital future. AI-assisted programming tools like  offer several advantages that go beyond streamlining the software development lifecycle for agile teams. They also contribute to enhancing code security through proactive vulnerability detection and secure code generation. For example,  employs advanced static code analysis and machine learning algorithms to continuously examine the code being written. It proactively identifies potential vulnerabilities, security loopholes, and coding practices that can expose systems to security hazards. By detecting issues in real-time, it reduces the risk of security and data breaches that can damage the company’s reputation and result in legal liabilities. Tools like  can guide developers to adhere to security coding standards and industry best practices. It offers suggestions for secure coding techniques and guidelines for secure authentication, authorisation, and data protection, helping developers write more secure code from the outset. For example, it can detect and recommend encryption techniques for handling sensitive data in compliance with data protection laws like GDPR or suggest secure authentication mechanisms that align with industry standards. Automated checks for compliance with industry standards and regulations help the company avoid costly penalties and legal complications. Promoting clean, well-structured code and automated adherence to coding standards help development teams minimise the accumulation of technical debt over time. They prevent shortcuts, hacks, and workarounds that frequently lead to a complicated web of code, making future updates and maintenance increasingly costly and time-consuming. Conversely, AI-driven suggestions guarantee that code is created in a comprehensive and consistent manner, thereby lessening the cost burden brought on by extensive refactoring, codebase rewrites, and extended development schedules, and hence reducing the danger of technical debt accumulation. No longer confined to the traditional realms of coding and debugging, developers are emerging as creative problem solvers and innovators, driving the very essence of technological advancement. In this section, we delineate how AI-assisted programming tools like  have accelerated and empowered this change in developers’ function, and how these technologies not only speed up development chores but also serve as invaluable mentors, offering on-the-job learning experiences and exposing developers to a breadth of coding styles and techniques. AI-assisted programming tools like  foster on-the-job learning opportunities for developers. These tools, powered by machine learning and code analysis, actively assist developers in real-time, suggesting code snippets and offering insights into best practices and emerging technologies. With recommendations spanning a wide range of programming languages, libraries, and frameworks, developers can diversify their skill set effortlessly. By promoting continuous learning within the development workflow, developers not only gain proficiency in current technologies but also remain primed to embrace emerging trends. This translates to a more innovative and agile organisation, ultimately contributing to the company’s competitive edge and long-term success in the ever-evolving digital landscape. Employees who appreciate professional development may find these tools that assist continual learning and skill improvement appealing. In fact, 71% of workers surveyed in a Gallup study felt that job training and development increased their job satisfaction, and 61% indicated that upskilling opportunities are an important reason to stay at their job. Hence, the use of such tools may in turn result in a higher retention rate. What further establishes the long-term retention of employees is the fact that these tools reduce the monotony commonly associated with repetitive and time-consuming coding tasks. Empowering developers of the future to automate routine tasks and instead focus on more meaningful and intellectually stimulating aspects of their work increases job satisfaction. For instance, a survey conducted revealed that 60-75% developers who utilised  felt more fulfilled with their job, felt less frustrated when coding and were able to focus on more satisfying work. Similarly, 73% of developers reported that the tool helped them stay in the flow, and 87% of them could preserve mental effort during repetitive tasks.1 Overall, offering cutting-edge tools can make a company more attractive to top tech talents, as skilled developers are more likely to stay with a company that provides them with the tools and resources they need to excel in their roles. The ability to attract and retain these talents is crucial today as programmer scarcity is an increasingly pressing concern for organisations, with the global tech talent shortage expected to reach 85.2 million by 2030 . Developer shortage has stalled new projects in recent years, but AI-assisted programming tools like  offer a compelling solution. By upskilling existing talent, Copilot not only mitigates the recruitment pressure but also elevates the company’s agility and cost-efficiency. Developers are provided with instant access to a wealth of coding knowledge, gaining assistance to tasks ranging from routine to complex. The acceleration of development cycles also enables current team members to handle more tasks with greater efficiency. This, in turn, reduces the need for extensive external hiring and helps organisations to navigate the developer shortage with confidence.       From: https://github.blog/2022-09-07-research-quantifying-github-copilots-impact-on-developer-productivity-and-happiness/

                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  Final week of July 2024 marked a pivotal moment for open-source AI development, with two major advancements pushing these models to the forefront of technological innovation and potentially broadening access to advanced AI tools. First, Meta’s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, introduced Llama 3.1, a leading-edge model made freely available to everyone. Just a day later, Mistral, a French AI startup, unveiled Mistral Large 2, a strong competitor to the top AI models. The convergence of this new generation of LLMs with the growing GenAI excitement of business executives since ChatGPT’s release signals a paradigm shift in the development of LLMs that will result in: As the landscape of available LLMs gets more crowded by the day, companies looking to explore LLMs and GenAI face an increasingly difficult, but fundamental, question:  This article proposes a lens through which companies can gain perspective and make an informed decision. To navigate the sea of LLMs successfully,  these models have is crucial. Specifically, it is important to understand if the model is: A deep understanding of one’s use case is required to match the right model characteristics to the application requirements. Questions to be answered include: On the business side, executives should conduct a  to understand if the adoption of GenAI will boost or hamper value creation. Should GenAI potentially be a major disruptor to their industry, companies should also  on which they can capitalise. Lastly, companies must be aware of the reputation of the LLM vendor, and the  they will receive in running their LLMs. The technical considerations fall into three distinct categories. First, for data, companies must select their LLMs in accordance with their  and security requirements, and with data availability, a key enabler for the option of fine-tuning. Next, companies must also be cognisant of the model’s  , as well as how  , especially so in cases of potential competitive advantage. Finally, deployment options must also be closely considered, and companies need to be aware of the  At the current state of LLM development, it is highly unlikely that companies will be able to identify a ‘silver bullet’ LLM that will provide for all their GenAI needs. But having this informed perspective into evaluating and assessing LLMs will enable companies to explore the available options competently and confidently, and to also make the switch when a golden opportunity presents itself in the future. An internal Google memo, that was leaked in May 2023, claimed that Open Source AI would outcompete Google and Open AI, summed up simply with the phrase: “we have no moat”1. The release of Meta’s LLaMA models gave open-source LLM development impetus, which has led to the creation of models that have shown to be able to ‘punch above their weight,’ doing much more with much less. Open-source development, far from being a sideshow to the research efforts of Big Tech corporate labs, has begun to pave a crucial, divergent path in the space of LLM creation and development. That divergent development, compounded with the growing excitement of business executives for Generative AI (GenAI) following the release of ChatGPT, has resulted in three key shifts in the GenAI and LLM market that we believe will have a profound impact on businesses. Namely, (1) increased business adoption of GenAI; (2) divergent trends in LLM development (general purpose vs. task-oriented); and (3) a notable change to permissive open-source LLM licenses. Business executives are now flocking to implement some form of GenAI in their companies in the hope that it can help them to improve their business outcomes. Seeing a growing market of unmet demand, some GenAI startups have pivoted their solutions from the consumer to the enterprise space. Tome, a startup that offers an AI-powered tool designed to help users create dynamic, visually compelling narratives without the need for traditional slide decks, shifted its focus from consumer products to more revenue-generating enterprise space2. As industries continue to bring their GenAI use cases forward, there is a divergent trend in how LLMs are being developed. While LLM development has generally been dominated by hyperscaler LLMs, there is also a wave of industry-specific LLMs that are being trained with industry knowledge to perform better on high value use cases. Open-weight models such as Codestral, code-specific LLM released by Mistral, are challenging products such as GitHub CoPilot by driving the adoption of self-hosted coding assistant3. As open-source communities find their footing to compete with Big Tech resources, we observe that more permissive open-source LLM licenses are gaining traction. As it stands, the landscape of LLMs is crowded, and will get even more so week by week. Companies intending to explore the capabilities of LLMs are faced with a simple but fundamental question: Which one? The rapid proliferation of LLMs in the market, because of GenAI hype, is leading to ‘choice overload.’ We believe that deeper clarity in how to understand the characteristics of these new models will help companies to make more informed decisions. These considerations span across the model type, use case, business design and technical design, and have been detailed out in the next few sections. Almost all the most noteworthy LLMs, including GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, and most recently, Llama 3.1, are general-purpose models. Having been trained on material scraped from the internet, these models can perform a wide variety of tasks, on an endless range of topics, and are like an AI-powered encyclopaedia virtual assistant. A user would just need to be able to prompt the model properly to get the desired output and information. It is the seemingly limitless capabilities of these models that have driven much of the excitement surrounding LLMs. However, there are other LLMs trained with a specific context or industry in mind. Some examples include Med-PaLM for medical knowledge and Codestral for coding applications. These models are trained to be more accurate and reliable for a chosen field or use case and are more like subject matter experts for that industry. Many of the early LLMs were also proprietary, with the companies doing research on them mainly publishing research papers, and only providing limited access on request to selected users. This behaviour has continued until today, with many noteworthy models not fully released to the public with access restricted through an API. For the most part, interaction with these models is done via prompt engineering, but there are providers who also allow for some customisation through fine-tuning. In recent times, however, open-source communities have begun to catch and have developed high-performing models that can compete with the performance of proprietary LLMs. Offering varying degrees of license permissiveness, the creators of these models allow anyone to be able to download the actual model file, and experiment with it, enabling greater flexibility and customisability, not just in terms of the model outputs, but also in deployment. In terms of deployment, LLMs have been deployed in many ways. For proprietary models like GPT-4, users do not have direct access to the models themselves but interact with them through an API using prompt engineering. Users can pay for API usage through a subscription or on a pay-per-use basis, where the user pays for tokens which are consumed when prompting the model and when generating the content requested. One concern over the use of an API is the lack of trust regarding the security of the application in handling the data being fed into it. Other providers can help users to host their custom models on a private cloud. Under this option, users are generally able to fine-tune their models as well as ensure data is not being mismanaged, all while not having to invest in expensive compute infrastructure. While this helps to address the concern of data privacy and customisation, users are expected to pay for all the services they require, which includes fine-tuning costs on top of the inferencing costs. In addition, a custom model that has been fine-tuned with the user’s data is not considered the intellectual property of the user themselves. If the data required to prompt the model is extremely sensitive, or if there is a critical need to protect a user’s IP to maintain competitive advantage, users can opt to host their LLM on-premises. While this option gives the user a greater level of flexibility and control over the LLM, the data, and the resulting IP, it comes with its own set of challenges including the need to invest is expensive compute infrastructure, substantial engineering, and the recruitment or training of talent to ensure the LLM’s capability to affect business outcomes. To address this, infrastructure technology providers are building tools to reduce the complexity of solutions and to increase developer productivity. In March 2024, NVIDIA announced NIM (NVIDIA Inference Microservices), a set of easy-to-use microservices designed to accelerate the deployment of generative AI models across the cloud, data centres and workstations4. To effectively identify which LLM is most suitable, a good understanding of the requirements of the use case is crucial. While each use case will be unique, there are helpful ways to examine use cases to gain clarity about pain points and how the LLM can be integrated to address those points. There are potential use cases that will require very specific domain knowledge such as those in the medical, legal, and coding industries, to name a few. The knowledge and training requirements of the model will limit the suitable LLMs available, and it is also possible that no LLM has yet been trained on the desired knowledge base. If a readily available domain specific LLM cannot be found, other options, such as fine-tuning a base LLM, will need to be explored. One key consideration for integrating GenAI is understanding the degree of automation required for the particular use case. If it can be expected that the model will be left to automate some processes on its own, the tolerance for error will be low. On the other hand, if the GenAI solution is there to assist users in completing their tasks, having that human-in-the-loop to curate and screen the model’s outputs will mean that the tolerance for error will be much higher. Knowing how GenAI fits into the workflow of operations will help users understand what level of performance is expected from the LLM and if additional measures like fine-tuning are necessary. A closely related consideration is the value-at-stake of the use case itself. If the use case is one where there is high value-at-stake (i.e., large contract amount, medical applications), the error tolerance will be very low, so the output of the LLM used must be very reliable so as not to jeopardise the solution. But if the use case’s value-at-stake is much lower, the inherent variance of model output can be acceptable and an LLM that performs just ‘well enough’ can be tolerated. Some use cases may deal with highly sensitive matters, such as personal or high value information, or possibly national security interests, in the case of government agencies. In these situations, the security of the data used for prompting and fine-tuning, as well as the model outputs themselves, must be treated with the utmost vigilance. The security requirements of the use case will affect the chosen deployment method, which then affects the range of suitable LLMs available to the user. With a deeper understanding of the use case, selecting a suitable LLM with characteristics that match the requirements becomes a simpler task. Use cases that require a high reliability of model outputs will require an LLM that has been proven to perform at a high level. If none are available, selecting an LLM that supports fine-tuning becomes crucial. Use cases that require specific domain knowledge will be best served either by existing LLMs that are already trained with the necessary data, or by LLMs that can be fine-tuned to meet that requirement. Use cases that have high security requirements will necessitate either a private cloud environment or even on-premises hosting to ensure the necessary security standards. Additionally, there are other design considerations that companies must take into account in evaluating, and ultimately selecting, an LLM. Fundamentally, the use of the LLM should help an organisation to better achieve its business outcomes. Implementing GenAI, without a clear vision, will create distractions instead of creating value. One key calculation for companies looking to implement GenAI is a cost-benefit analysis. Balancing the capital expenditures (compute resources, GPUs) and operating expenses (licensing fees, salaries) of investing in LLMs with the value they create in terms of cost savings, productivity, or new revenue is critical, and companies should begin with the end in mind, and aim towards a positive return on investment. An interesting trend is LLM providers are passing on the gains from optimised implementations and decreasing cost of hardware to customers by charging less even as model performance rises. A significant trend to note is the reduction in prices by large language model providers for their customers. This is due to enhanced efficiency in implementation and decreasing hardware costs, even as the performance of these models continues to improve. The cost to achieve an Elo rating of 1250 has dramatically dropped by a factor of 100, from roughly $30/million tokens for Claude 3 Opus in March 2024 to $0.30/million tokens for gpt-4o-mini in July 20241. Following a recent price cut by OpenAI, GPT-4o tokens are now priced at $4 per million tokens, based on a blended rate that assumes 80% input and 20% output tokens. When GPT-4 was initially released in March 2023, it cost $36 per million tokens. This price reduction over a span of 17 months equates to an approximate 79% annual drop in price. Another consideration is the degree to which implementing GenAI will generate a competitive advantage for the business. If the integration of GenAI can potentially be a key differentiator, or if GenAI could be disruptive to one’s own industry, companies would be well-advised to explore LLMs closely to ride the wave of disruption, or risk sinking instead. Being cognisant of the shifting trends will help industry executives anticipate the opportunities and threats that GenAI will pose to their businesses. Finally, executives should also consider the reputations of the vendors providing LLMs. Working with LLMs can be a tricky process, and the level of support provided by the vendor is crucial to a successful exploration. For open-source LLMs, having clear documentation and community support will go a long way toward simplifying the installation and deployment processes. There are numerous technical considerations that companies must also be aware of in selecting an LLM, among which data management and security are key. Not all LLMs can be integrated into a secure environment, so selecting an LLM that can be hosted securely will be crucial for companies that possess a lot of sensitive data. Data availability is another important consideration when selecting an LLM. A company that has large amounts of high-quality data can leverage their data resources to engineer better prompts, or even perform fine-tuning, and should select an LLM that can support this capability. For use cases that require higher model output reliability, it may be better to explore a customisable model that can be fine-tuned for a specified use case using proprietary data. If data is not as readily available, companies should target LLMs that have performed well against common benchmarks. In the case of open-source models, if the resulting solution will potentially become an important source of competitive advantage, LLMs with more permissive licenses should be considered ahead of those that are less permissive, so that the IP can be protected. Another important factor is the benchmarking performance of the LLMs. There are currently different benchmarks available that are used to evaluate and rank the performance of LLMs on various applications and use cases and are equated to standardised testing for language models. Leaderboards, such as those prepared by LMSYS5 and Hugging Face6, provide visibility by creating a snapshot of the benchmarking performance of various LLMs in comparison to each other. Companies must also note that while benchmarks may be helpful tools in comparing LLM performance, they do not have the inherent ability to evaluate the quality of the content generated by the models in real world situations which is a difficult task and remains an open research challenge. If ensuring data privacy or IP protection is critical, companies should consider LLMs that can be deployed in secure environments. Additional deployment considerations are the necessary operational requirements of the model, such as the compute infrastructure and engineering effort required, and the talent needed to execute the various LLM operations. Companies must be aware of the resources currently available to them and decide if they would prefer to invest in more resources to use a larger, more complex model, or to find a model that can be deployed given their existing levels of resources. At the current state of LLM development, it is highly unlikely that companies will be able to identify an LLM that is a potential “silver bullet” for all their GenAI needs. Complex use cases may even require the deployment of a portfolio of LLMs, used in concert, to produce the desired output, provided that available resources allow for the use of multiple models. The framework proposed should help businesses to objectively assess available LLMs and to decide on one (or a few) to explore and, we hope, make the process less daunting. Selecting an LLM is just one of the initial steps and should not become a roadblock in the exciting process of GenAI exploration. As this space continues to evolve rapidly, having an informed perspective on one’s use case and the available LLMs will be crucial for companies in distinguishing between noise and necessity. Most of the new releases should not delay or derail a company’s planned exploration of GenAI using a selected LLM, but keeping a keen eye on ongoing LLM releases and developments will help companies to identify important switching opportunities as and when they present themselves.

                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  Generative AI (GenAI) has emerged as a groundbreaking technology with immense potential to revolutionise various aspects of our society. From enabling digital transformation in both large corporations and small organisations, to enhancing creativity and productivity, GenAI, such as ChatGPT, has opened new avenues for innovation and progress. However, while we celebrate the possibilities offered by this technology, it is crucial to acknowledge that its unrestricted use can give rise to significant risks and unintended consequences. In the context of unrestricted use GenAI, we delve into the multifaceted nature of GenAI, particularly ChatGPT, and the need for an appropriate governance framework to ensure responsible and beneficial deployment. We explore the inherent risks associated with the unbridled use of ChatGPT and shed light on potential challenges that may arise if adequate precautions are not taken. Recognising the importance of a balance between harnessing the power of GenAI and safeguarding against its potential pitfalls, we aim to equip individuals, organisations, and policymakers with a comprehensive understanding of the risks involved. Moreover, we provide a set of general guidelines that can serve as a starting point for mitigating these risks to ensure the responsible and ethical use of ChatGPT. Through the establishment of effective governance measures, we can foster an environment where ChatGPT and similar technologies can thrive, to the benefit of society. The rapid growth and use of GenAI in many applications is due to its potential benefits in multiple dimensions: However, the use of GenAI can be a double-edged sword as the technology also poses several potential risks : In addition to these challenges, it is also important to be aware of the potential for GenAI to be used for malicious purposes. For example, it could be used to create fake news articles, social media posts, or even videos. This content could be used to spread misinformation and disinformation, which could have a negative impact on society. How do we strike a balance between enhanced productivity and the unethical use of ChatGPT? There are a few reasons why such a balancing act is challenging: As a result of these challenges, it is non-trivial to strike a balance between reaping productivity gains and the unrestricted or unethical use of ChatGPT. More work needs to be done to mitigate the risks and ensure that the tool is used in a responsible manner. According to Gartner, data privacy is the biggest concern based on a survey of 713 IT Executives. This is summarised in Figure 1 below. In general, OpenAI is likely to have the legal right to use personal information to train ChatGPT if the data is collected and used in compliance with applicable laws and if users have consented to this use. If OpenAI collects personal information from users who have agreed to its terms of service, which state that the data may be used to train ChatGPT, then OpenAI is likely to have the legal right to use that data for this purpose. However, there are some potential legal limitations on OpenAI’s use of personal information to train ChatGPT. Some jurisdictions have laws that restrict the collection and use of certain types of personal information, such as sensitive personal data or data pertaining to children. Additionally, some jurisdictions have laws that give individuals the right to opt out of having their personal data used for certain purposes, such as for training AI models. For example, ChatGPT was banned by the Italian data protection authority at the start of April 2023 over privacy concerns. The Italian data protection authority, also known as Garante, temporarily restricted the chatbot and launched a probe over the artificial intelligence application’s suspected breach. As Garante had accused OpenAI of failing to check the age of ChatGPT’s users (who are supposed to be aged thirteen or above), OpenAI said it would offer a tool to verify users’ ages in Italy upon sign-up. OpenAI explained that it would also provide a new form for European Union users to exercise their right to object to its use of their personal data to train its models. Access to the ChatGPT chatbot has since been restored in Italy  . The Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) published guidelines in July 2023, allowing limited use of Generative AI (GenAI) in elementary, junior high, and high schools. The guidelines are intended to help teachers and students understand the characteristics of the technology, while imposing some limits due to fear of copyright infringement, personal information leaks, and plagiarism . The guidelines state that Generative AI can be used for educational purposes, such as: However, the guidelines also caution that Generative AI should not be used for the following purposes: The guidelines also state that elementary school students younger than age 13 can use AI, to a certain extent, under the guidance of teachers. The MEXT’s decision to allow limited use of Generative AI in schools was a significant step, as Japan became one of the first countries in the world with such a government policy. The guidelines are still in the initial stages, and it remains to be seen how they will be implemented in practice. However, the move is a sign that Japan is recognising the potential of Generative AI to transform education. On the other hand, the Australian Federal Government opened an inquiry last year into the use of Generative AI within its education system  . The Australian Federal Government’s inquiry into the use of Generative AI in education is a significant development, as it was one of the first governments in the world to take such a step. The inquiry will examine the following key areas: Schools in Australia have now officially rolled out the use of artificial intelligence bot ChatGPT. The decision to allow ChatGPT in schools was made after a consultation with teachers, students, parents, and education experts. The consultation found that there is a strong demand for the use of ChatGPT in schools, and that the potential benefits of using this technology outweigh the risks  . The Australian government is working with OpenAI to develop guidelines for the responsible and ethical use of ChatGPT in schools. The guidelines will cover areas such as: To address the ethical and societal concerns surrounding AI, including Generative AI, it is essential to develop and operationalise an effective governance framework within an organisation. These frameworks should be designed to ensure that AI is used in a responsible and ethical manner. Some of the overarching principles of effective AI governance include: Once the overarching AI principles have been defined, a governance framework that sets out how these principles will be put into practice needs to be developed. This framework should include policies and procedures for the development, deployment, monitoring, and evaluation of AI systems. Here are some examples of key elements of an AI governance framework: The US Department of Commerce National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST AI Risk Management Framework   and Singapore’s Infocomm Media Development Authority’s Model AI Governance Framework   provide useful guidelines and further details on how an effective governance framework might look. AI risk and impact assessments should be conducted regularly to identify and mitigate any potential risks. These assessments should consider the following factors: By conducting regular AI risk and impact assessments, organisations can ensure that AI systems are used in a safe and responsible manner. GenAI can be used to create a wide variety of content, including text, code, images, and videos. This content can be used for good or malicious purposes, so it is important to have safeguards in place to prevent GenAI from being used maliciously. Some recommended practices that organisations should consider when adopting a responsible approach to AI, in particular with the rise of GenAI and ChatGPT, are as follows: In addition to these recommendations, it is also important to be transparent about how ChatGPT is used. Organisations should inform users about what data is being collected, how it is being used, and what they can expect from the output of the model. It is also important to have a process in place for users to report any problems or concerns they have about the use of ChatGPT. By taking these steps, we will go a long way in ensuring that ChatGPT is used in a responsible and ethical way.       Generative AI: Implications for Trust and Governance.

                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  Customer contact centres play a pivotal role across a wide array of industries, including telecommunications, banking, and the public sector. These centres serve as the front line for customer interactions, addressing queries, resolving issues, and enhancing customer satisfaction. The contact centre industry is not just widespread but also deeply globalised. Many organisations have outsourced and offshored their customer service functions to leverage cost efficiencies and access to skilled labour in various regions. As of today, the global contact centre industry employs over 17 million people worldwide and represents a market worth US$30 billion in 2023. This expansive industry continues to evolve rapidly, driven by technological advancements, with AI poised to be a transformative force. In this article, we explore how AI impacts contact centres in two important ways: 1) improving the productivity of the contact centre agent, by allowing the agent to not only do existing tasks better in less time, but also take on new value-adding tasks; and 2) enhancing the effectiveness of organisation to ensure the agents comply with organisation-specific policies and industry rules and regulations. Contact centre staff perform a variety of essential tasks that ensure smooth and efficient customer interactions. Their responsibilities include answering inbound calls, handling customer complaints, processing orders and payments, and providing detailed information about products and services. In addition to managing customer accounts and scheduling appointments, they often respond to emails and live chat messages, ensuring that all customer queries are addressed promptly. They also follow up on customer requests and conduct satisfaction surveys to gather feedback for continuous improvement. Adhering to scripts and compliance guidelines, particularly in regulated industries, ensures consistency and adherence to legal standards. With AI’s growing presence, many of these routine tasks are expected to become automated, allowing staff to focus more on complex, value-added activities. The impact of AI would vary, depending on the nature of the call centre operations to begin with. In a next-gen contact centre scenario that we envisioned with a group of Telcos, GenAI acts as an assistant to the call centre agent across the lifecycle of a call: In a recent implementation with a 250-strong call centre in Singapore, GenAI was applied successfully to 2 key areas: The underlying technology products and services used to modernise this contact centre included AWS Bedrock cloud services, Anthropic’s Claude Instant LLM and NCS’ proprietary speech-to-text engine called Ins8.ai. With the successful implementation, the technology architecture and deployment roadmap now serve as a reference template for other similar contact centres globally. In the highly regulated world of financial services, banks, insurance companies and other advisory firms face significant challenges in ensuring compliance and preventing misconduct by their customer service agents or relationship managers (RMs). Manual and error-prone monitoring processes often lead to delayed detection of non-compliant behaviour, exposing banks to risks and potential penalties. Banks and insurance companies face multiple hurdles in ensuring compliance within their organisations including a high volume of interactions, staff turnover, frequent product and policy updates, and the emergence of new regulations. The current manual approaches to compliance are insufficient to keep pace with the scale and speed of change. Banks require large compliance teams to manually monitor just a small percentage of calls, resulting in significant latency and less-than-comprehensive oversight of non-compliant behaviour. Recent cases of personal bankers deceiving customers resulted in financial loss and damage to the banks’ reputations, and highlight the limitations of the existing approach to compliance, such as the case reported by The Straits Times on 21 Aug 2024 wherein MAS issued a 9 year prohibition order against a large ASEAN bank’s relationship manager for misconduct. Earlier this year, in Jan 2024, Bloomberg reported on the Credit Suisse AT1 bond fallout hitting a large Indian bank, where customers alleged that the bank’s relationship manager mis-sold the bonds by saying they were secure and failing to explain the risks. Leveraging advanced language models and automated hyperlocal speech recognition, NCS developed the  to enable real-time monitoring, actionable insights, and enhanced performance management. This innovative solution addresses the problem statement “Is my Relationship Manager compliant with both internal and external regulatory policies and guidelines?’ and utilises real-world conversations, bank policies, ethical guidelines, and regulations (such as those of the Financial Advisers Act/MAS, in Singapore) as inputs. By combining these inputs with the power of GenAI, the  provides real-time alerts on non-compliance, generates comprehensive reports, and facilitates targeted training plans for RMs, enabling a holistic view of RM performance (Refer to Figures 2 and 3). Implementing the  and integrating it within a bank’s business processes/IT environment can lead to significant improvements in compliance metrics. The percentage of calls monitored can be increased to 100% from the current 5-10% standard, instantly reducing the 3-6 months latency observed today. Furthermore, the solution can reduce the number of manhours by 80-90%, thus streamlining the compliance monitoring process and making it more efficient. The integration of AI, particularly Generative AI, into contact centre operations offers transformative benefits by significantly enhancing both productivity and compliance management. On the productivity front, AI-driven solutions enable agents to perform routine tasks more efficiently, reducing time spent on repetitive activities and freeing them to focus on more complex, value-added interactions. By automating processes such as live speech-to-text transcription, post-call summaries, and personalised training, AI allows agents to handle more calls, improve customer satisfaction, and take on new responsibilities that contribute to business growth. In terms of compliance management, AI is a game-changer for industries like banking and insurance, where regulatory adherence is critical. The  , for instance, provides real-time monitoring and insights, ensuring that every interaction is aligned with both internal policies and external regulations. This not only mitigates risk but also streamlines the compliance process by automating what was once a labour-intensive task. With AI, contact centres can monitor 100% of interactions, significantly reducing latency and minimising the likelihood of non-compliance. In essence, AI empowers organisations to enhance productivity while maintaining rigorous compliance standards, driving both efficiency and effectiveness in contact centre operations.

Executive summary Challenges with ASR capability in an ASEAN context Understanding NCS’ ASR capability and Generative AI Comparison with open-source ASRs How will AI shape solutions for innovation? Contact us 
                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) is a common tool used by many businesses to ensure that customer conversations are captured and retained for customer service, legal, and compliance purposes. But linguistic factors can create challenges to ensuring the accurate transcription of conversations, particularly in regions as linguistically diverse as Southeast Asia. Based on our experience, most AI solutions have challenges in interpreting our local accented speech which often contains a mix of borrowed words from different languages and dialects, idiosyncratic syntax and grammar as well as references to local places. In this article, we explore the immense potential of ASR to revolutionise business operations, empower growth, and drive unparalleled conversational understanding. Additionally, we will address the current challenges in ASR capabilities, especially in an ASEAN context. Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) is a technology that converts spoken language into written text. While ASR technology has been around for some time, several challenges persist, particularly in the ASEAN context: NCS’ very own ASR product, Ins8.ai, is an advanced hyperlocal large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) product developed by the NCS Ins8.ai product team and NCS NEXT Gen Tech teams. It was trained using local call centre data on multiple ASEAN languages and excels in handling accents, dialects, and creole languages, making it ideal for Asia. The core technology is a deep neural network architected and fine-tuned by the Ins8.ai team to ensure exceptional accuracy for spoken creole languages in Asia, such as Singlish. Ins8.ai overcomes the barriers from accents and extended vocabularies that can be challenging for traditional ASR technologies. In our comprehensive comparison between the NCS Ins8.ai product and Open AI’s Whisper (ASR system trained on 680,000 hours of audio datasets collected from the web, two-thirds of which are in English), the results clearly demonstrated Ins8.ai’s superiority. Ins8.ai outperformed, producing the lowest word error rate (WER) despite maintaining a small model size (just one-sixth that of Open AI’s Whisper medium model) for typical call centre conversations in Singlish while running at a much higher speed of transcription (Figure 1). In a recent implementation with a 250-strong call centre in Singapore, our ASR was applied successfully to live speech-to-text transcription for Singlish, with an accuracy rate of 95% with the ability to interpret Singlish terms like “shiok”, “can-can” and “Wah-low” as well as local places in Singapore. This is in line with the statistics above and compares favourably to out-of-the-box STT which generally has an accuracy rate of 70-80% for Singlish. Beyond call centres, this capability can also be applied to other use cases, such as: Our dedication to developing cutting-edge technology has led to Ins8.ai’s unparalleled performance, making it the clear choice for anyone seeking industry-leading automatic speech recognition capabilities.

Introduction Narrow AI Foundation models GPT for robotics Vision-language-action model Simulation for data generation Humanoid race Multi-robot coordination Summary References How will AI shape solutions for innovation? Contact us 
                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  The need for adaptive solutions that can handle dynamic environments has led to a paradigm shift towards robotic systems with increased autonomy and the capability to thrive in unpredictable settings. This shift is most evident in the rise in popularity of autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) over automated guided vehicles (AGVs) that normally operate on fixed routes and have difficulty adjusting to changing environments. According to The Robot Report , it is forecasted that 50% of all mobile robot shipments will be AMRs and less than 25% will be AGVs by 2025. Despite this push towards autonomy, robotics task planning is still dominated by classical methods that are based on rigid, hard-coded instructions. However, there is a growing recognition of the limitations inherent in this method given the demands of modern use cases. Narrow deep learning model use in robotics applications has gained momentum across applications for use cases ranging from perception tasks that use object detection/segmentation models for finding objects of interest, to training specific robot skills using deep reinforcement learning techniques. In the context of robot task planning involving human-robot interactions, the most common approach typically employs hand-engineered rules paired with deep learning models. These models are trained to find contextual relationships between the user’s input (the task) and pre-determined keywords (commonly referred to as ‘intents’) that act as triggers for numerous pre-programmed sequences. While offering determinism to the system (as all behaviours are known to the designer beforehand), this approach often struggles to generalise when system alterations to location, time, or logistics occur, and with the introduction of new robot functions. Additionally, scaling proves challenging, particularly with multi-step instructions, due to the intricacies of crafting nested rules for all possible permutations. Foundation models, on the other hand, are pre-trained on massive internet-scale data and can be adapted to suit diverse tasks. These models have demonstrated notable advancements such as OpenAI’s Dall-E , an AI model that can generate realistic images and art, and GPT-33 , the language model that serves as the foundation for ChatGPT. The advent of foundation models has created new options, as researchers start to explore their use in equipping robots with common sense knowledge and the ability to interpret human instructions in a more intuitive manner. A simple task such as “Get me a can of soda” may appear trivial to humans but has proven to be challenging for robots thus far. This challenge arises from the need for robots to not only execute complex algorithms to complete the task, but to also comprehend human instructions and translate them into actionable steps that fall within the robot’s capabilities. In this article, we will discuss recent advancements in the application of foundation models and how these models could transform the way robots are programmed, moving towards a new paradigm of vision and text-based training. In the  paper published by GoogleAI  last year, researchers used a large language model (LLM) to interpret user instructions and rank the likelihood of success for each available skill that the robot would eventually use to accomplish a given task. Their proposed decision-making method achieved an 84% success rate in overall planning. The release and use of open-source foundation models gave robots advantages beyond task planning, and could empower them to seamlessly engage in natural language understanding, generation, and interaction, broadening the scope for communication and collaboration on various general-purpose tasks. Peter Chen of Covariant AI referred to the application of principles similar to ChatGPT as “GPT for robotics”  signalling the upcoming frontier for foundation models. These models, designed to tackle broader tasks instead of domain-specific problems, are trained on extensive datasets and provide robots with intelligence that can be generalisable across multiple tasks. Beyond text inputs, robots could also benefit from multi-modal foundation models that not only facilitate word comprehension, but also combine various senses as inputs to enhance robotic understanding of an environment. In September of 2023, OpenAI released an update for ChatGPT that allows the model to “see, hear and speak.” This new feature set allowed ChatGPT users to upload photos and ask the model questions that are related to the image. Recently, researchers have been experimenting with the same multi-modal approach (particularly using images) to aid robots with visual perspective for situational awareness and to learn new generalisable skills. In a recent TechCrunch interview , Ken Goldberg, a professor at UC Berkeley and the Chief Scientist of the robotics parcel startup, Ambidextrous, remarked that “2023 will be remembered as the year when Generative AI transformed Robotics” as roboticists discover that large vision-language-action (VLA) models can be trained to allow robots to see and control their motions. Google Deepmind researchers recently trained RT-2 , a VLA model, with web-scale data and a robot’s past experience to predict the robot’s actions and represented those actions as strings. The key objective of this work was to develop an AI model that can learn how to map what it sees (robot’s camera view) into robot-specific actions. Compared to SayCan, which acts as a decision maker by ranking the most suitable action based on contextual reasoning and feasibility, RT-2 directly controls the robot based on its visual and language interpretations. The Google Deepmind team’s work could unlock reasoning abilities, that had previously been challenging or nonexistent, for robots. For instance, in ‘worst-case’ situations when a robot encounters navigation errors, or gets stuck after avoiding an obstacle, traditional methods often struggle to recover, especially on edge cases that were not accounted for during development. In fact, there are companies that provide human-in-the-loop (HITL) services to remotely enable robots to resume operating in these situations, in order to increase the robot’s operating time to meet service level agreements (SLAs). With VLAs, operators could teach robots safe and effective recovery behaviours through hours of tele-operation videos and past HITL data. Tasks such as navigating through an HBD (Housing Development Board) void deck to locate lifts, which usually requires an intuitive understanding based on past experience, can also be made easier for robots. Robots could be trained to make decisions about where to turn, and to choose paths that have a higher probability of leading to a lift lobby, based on visual cues. This skill would be extremely useful for last-mile delivery robots when transiting from outdoor environments to indoor HDB units. Research performed by a team at UC Berkeley (“Navigation with large language models”)  demonstrated that robots can leverage the semantic information in large language models (LLMs) for navigating unfamiliar environments using the images from the robot’s camera. The LLM’s reasoning skills were used as the decision-making mechanism for determining the direction the robot should take to reach the desired goal or location, or to find the object of interest, based on what the robot perceived. To meet the huge data demands for training AI models, Generative AI could serve a unique function by generating data and simulating robot experiences. Dhruv Batra, the Research Director at Meta’s FAIR (Fundamental AI Research) lab, highlighted a compelling application of Generative AI  to produce 2D images, videos, and 3D scenes. This could be done using simulators to accelerate scene building and asset generation (quoting one of Deepu Talla’s use-cases  on how Generative AI could contribute to the future of robotics). A great practical example of this is the Isaac Simulator plugin , developed by Nvidia engineers, that enables users to create digital twin environments with a simple prompt that describes the desired 3D scene and the assets of interest. The plugin leverages ChatGPT to identify suitable furniture that is available in the simulator’s database and to arrange that furniture in a way that fulfills the desired simulation setup. For years, Boston Dynamics’ Atlas has been at the forefront of humanoid robotics, showcasing impressive feats of agility and balance. However, the field is rapidly evolving with new companies like 1X, Figure, and Tesla’s Optimus project joining the race to develop advanced humanoid robots. Having the shared goal of building general-purpose robots, these companies have been pushing the boundaries of what’s possible to create machines that can seamlessly integrate into human environments and perform a wide variety of tasks. Figure  and 1X  have recently partnered with OpenAI, underscoring the growing importance of foundation models in accelerating humanoid development. Adding to this momentum, NVIDIA announced Project GR00T  during GTC in March 2024. This initiative aims to create a general-purpose foundation model for humanoid robots, capable of processing multi-modal instructions and previous interactions. Leveraging NVIDIA’s advanced cloud-based GPU infrastructure optimised to run computer graphics suitable for simulation and training, Project GR00T enables robots to perform diverse tasks through both high-level reasoning and low-level motion control. The model’s ability to integrate self-observation with multi-modal learning techniques allows humanoid robots to react dynamically to their environment, potentially accelerating skill acquisition and development processes. The use of foundation models in humanoid robotics presents major advantages as these AI models have been trained on vast amounts of internet data, allowing them to map seen videos and observations into useful robot actuations to perform tasks. By leveraging the diverse and extensive data available on the internet, foundation models can “understand” a wide range of scenarios, objects, and actions. When applied to humanoid robots, this understanding translates into more adaptable and capable machines. For instance, a robot equipped with a foundation model might observe a human performing a new task – like folding a particular type of clothing or operating an unfamiliar device – and be able to replicate that action without explicit programming for that specific task. Moreover, this ability to map diverse data to physical actions enhances the robot’s interaction with its environment and with humans. It can lead to more intuitive human-robot communication, as the robot can better interpret natural language instructions or even non-verbal cues, translating them into appropriate actions. This paves the way for humanoid robots that can assist in various settings—from homes to hospitals to factories—with greater flexibility and understanding of context. Early in 2024, Google Deepmind released AutoRT , a system that combines large foundation models like LLMs and VLMs with robot control models like RT-2. This integration allows the system to deploy robots equipped with cameras and manipulators for various tasks in diverse environments. The VLM interprets the robot’s surroundings and identifies objects, while the LLM suggests creative tasks for the robot to perform. AutoRT can control multiple robots simultaneously, orchestrating them safely in real-world settings. The new system was mainly designed to collect data for robot training and worked by assessing the robot’s performance on executed tasks against previously recorded videos. Over seven months of extensive evaluations, the system successfully managed up to 20 robots at once and a total of 52 unique robots. Deepmind conducted 77,000 trials across 6,650 different tasks in office buildings. Although AutoRT is a data collection system, it demonstrates the potential of foundation models to coordinate robot fleets and offers a powerful tool for efficiently managing robots that can adapt in dynamic environments. The utilisation of this system could greatly benefit platforms like Robotmanager by allowing users the flexibility to transition from manual task assignments to an automated, intelligence-driven approach. Such an approach promises to help organisations optimise resources, streamline operations, and reduce the amount of human involvement currently required to control and manage robot fleets. The application of Generative AI in robotics holds immense potential for revolutionising the field by addressing key current challenges in human-robot interaction, task planning, multi-robot coordination, and data augmentation. The use of foundation models, such as vision-language models (VLMs) for enhanced perception, and large language models (LLMs) for task planning, will enable robots to better comprehend human instructions and to generate diverse plans for accomplishing user tasks. The multi-modal capabilities of VLMs, in particular, can play a pivotal role in augmenting robot perception, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of the environment. Additionally, the integration of systems like AutoRT will facilitate effective multi-robot coordination and enhance collaborative efforts in complex scenarios.       Ash Sharma, Mobile Robots Rapidly Mainstreaming by 2025, AGVs and MARS Deployed in 53K Facilities. https://www.therobotreport.com/mobile-robots-rapidly-mainstreaming-by-2025-agvs-and-amrs-

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  Artificial intelligence (AI) has rapidly evolved from a theoretical concept into a ubiquitous technology that touches nearly every industry and aspect of our life. However, despite its pervasiveness in conversation and its potential to revolutionise businesses, AI’s integration into operations is superficial. The reality is that while AI appears to be everywhere, its impact, depth of integration, and economic benefits are still emerging and unevenly distributed. This article provides an updated perspective on AI technology trends and state of AI adoption. The early wave of AI advancements focused on developing large, general-purpose models, such as the initial large language models (LLMs). These frontier models are becoming increasingly powerful, now incorporating multimodal capabilities that allow them to process and generate both text and images. However, as these models grow in size and complexity, they also bring significant sustainability challenges. The vast amounts of energy required to train and deploy these massive models result in substantial carbon footprints, raising concerns about their long-term environmental impact. GPT-3 which has 175 billion parameters is estimated to have produced ~550 metric tons of CO₂ equivalent emissions (Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI), 2023). To put it in perspective, this amount of CO₂ is roughly equivalent to flying from Singapore to New York USA and back 140 times. In response to these challenges, a parallel movement is gaining traction, emphasising the development of smaller, task-specific models (Figure 1). These models are designed to perform well on specific tasks with greater efficiency, consuming far less energy and reducing environmental impact. Despite their smaller size, these models often rival larger ones in their respective domains, demonstrating that in AI, bigger isn’t always better. The shift towards more sustainable, use-case-driven solutions highlights a growing recognition of the need for AI to be both powerful and environmentally responsible. A significant shift in AI technology is the rise of open models, which are publicly accessible through open-source, open-weight parameters or both, enabling broader use and further development by community. These open models are increasingly rivalling proprietary, closed models. Historically, major tech companies developed and dominated the AI landscape with their proprietary models, limiting access to the most advanced capabilities. However, the emergence of powerful open-source models is democratising access to cutting-edge AI, enabling a broader range of organisations to leverage AI technologies. Figure 2 shows how open-weight models, particularly with the release of Llama3.1 in July 2024, are closing the gap with closed-source ones. These open models offer cost advantages and foster innovation through community-driven development. As more businesses and researchers contribute to these models, they rapidly improve in performance and usability. The growing adoption of open-source models represents a significant shift in how AI technologies are developed and deployed. We can expect more open models challenging the dominance of closed, proprietary systems and offering new opportunities for businesses to innovate. Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a cornerstone of enterprise use of Generative AI. As shown in Figure 3, RAG combines retrieval-based systems where information is pulled from the organisation’s database of existing knowledge, with Generative AI models that create new content based on that information. This hybrid approach ensures that the risks of AI model “hallucination” are reduced and that the AI outputs are not only accurate but also contextually relevant, providing tailored insights for business decisions. As businesses increasingly rely on AI, RAG enhances the quality and reliability of AI applications, underscoring the need for sophisticated data management and well-structured strategies to unlock AI’s full potential. In the near future, we can anticipate a significant increase in tools and services leveraging RAG to enable enterprises to effectively mine their proprietary and third-party data using Generative AI. RAG is likely to be viewed as a more accessible and cost-effective alternative to fine-tuning LLMs. With the rise of LLMs, LLM-based AI agents have also trended strongly in 2024.  AI agents promise a new frontier in which the AI systems are designed to not only analyse data and make recommendations but to autonomously execute actions within defined parameters. Unlike conventional AI, which typically requires human oversight for critical decision-making, agentic AI models are engineered to be capable of reasoning, planning and tool calling which allow them to independently pursue objectives and respond dynamically to new data in real-time environments. Recent advancements in agentic AI have introduced more adaptive and flexible systems capable of handling complex, multi-step tasks that mimic human autonomy. These advances are starting to transform how organisations can deploy AI, particularly in sectors like transport and logistics, customer service and finance, where rapid decision-making is essential.  An example of agentic AI in action is within the Road Transport Operations Centre, whereby agentic AI monitors road traffic conditions using CCTVs and other road infrastructure sensors as well as car-bound telemetry sources, detects anomalies (such as traffic build-up due to road accidents) and automatically activates a set of defined protocols in response to the anomalies (e.g., alerting the first responders and other emergency agencies) with minimal human intervention. However, the rise of agentic AI also raises unique ethical and regulatory challenges. The capacity for autonomous decision-making introduces potential risks, from unintended actions to biases in the agent’s learning process. As organizations consider agentic AI, robust governance frameworks will be essential to prevent undesirable outcomes. Looking forward, agentic AI is poised to extend beyond rule-based, pre-programmed behaviors to more adaptable, goal-driven operations, paving the way for next-generation applications across industries. The evolving landscape of agentic AI signals not only an advancement in automation but a shift towards AI that can proactively shape its own processes and deliver more efficient, tailored solutions with minimal human guidance. With a market share north of 85%, NVIDIA is the most dominant AI hardware vendor, providing the advanced computing chips or GPUs crucial for training and deploying the LLMs and other foundation models. In 2023, Microsoft and Meta emerged as significant buyers of NVIDIA’s H100 GPUs, spending $9 billion combined and acquiring around 150,000 chips each. Additionally, Google and Amazon purchased approximately 50,000 chips each. Tesla, another large customer, bought 15,000 chips, with plans to increase this number significantly. These figures highlight the substantial investments by these tech giants in AI infrastructure, contributing nearly 40% of NVIDIA’s revenue (Tremayne-Pengelly, 2024). The rapid adoption of AI by the tech giants has created a bottleneck in the supply of GPUs. These giants have the resources to secure these components, leaving smaller players struggling to keep up. Analysts are predicting the GPU market will grow at a CAGR of 34% over the next decade (Figure 4). With the current industry dynamic, it will not be surprising that this growth be accompanied by an increasingly uneven playing field where only the most resourceful companies can thrive. Localisation is becoming increasingly important in AI deployment. To be truly effective, AI systems must consider the specific needs and conditions of local markets. This has led to the rise of new AI players who offer industry-focused solutions tailored to local contexts, providing businesses with more choices in navigating AI adoption. Figure 5 shows the ongoing work that is done by NCS to build a conversational AI system that could understand the Singaporean-accented speech with its use of borrowed words from other languages and many references to local places and events. It is an example of how localisation can improve the performance of AI systems. While the US is the clear leader in the source of top AI models, China dominates AI patents. In 2022, China’s patenting activities significantly outstripped the US, accounting for 61% of global AI patent origins compared to US’ 21% (Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI), 2023). Notably, in Hugging Face’s second leaderboard that ranks open LLMs against more challenging variety of tasks, Alibaba’s 千问 (Qianwen) models featured prominently among the top-ranked open models on Hugging Face leaderboard. The notion of AI leadership being confined to the West is misplaced. China’s rapid development and official approval of adoption of LLMs, urging both citizens and enterprises to embrace AI on a large scale, highlights the prospect that China will continue to be a hotbed for many AI innovations to come and can provide businesses and governments with meaningful alternative AI solutions. While the technology trends in AI are impressive, a closer examination reveals that many businesses are still engaging with AI at a superficial level. Despite the hype and the fear of missing out (FOMO), AI adoption often lacks depth, driven more by external pressures than by a deep, strategic understanding of how AI can transform operations. According to the 2024 Gartner Hype Cycle Report, “Generative AI is sliding into the trough of disillusionment” (Mearian, 2024). A recent survey by IDC reveals that in the Asia-Pacific region, only 4% of respondents have yet to introduce AI into their operations (Figure 7). This widespread interest in AI is not surprising, given the impressive technological advancements and the continuous hype from technology vendors. Additionally, national initiatives like Singapore’s National AI Strategy 2.0 are fuelling this momentum, encouraging businesses to adopt AI to enhance competitiveness across industries. However, as businesses wade into the AI era, they are starting to encounter challenges that temper their enthusiasm. Usability, safety, and enterprise readiness have surfaced as significant concerns. Many AI systems, while powerful, are not yet fully equipped to handle the complexities of real-world applications. This has made businesses more cautious about which use cases to pursue and how deeply to integrate AI into their operations. Moreover, the lack of skilled personnel to manage and interpret AI systems often leads to suboptimal outcomes. Without the necessary expertise, businesses struggle to fully harness AI’s capabilities, resulting in implementations that fall short of expectations. Their use of AI tends to be experimental in nature, or in localised production systems for specific narrow parts of the business. This state of “AI dust” can be overcome. To fully harness the potential of AI, companies must not only have a well-thought AI adoption strategy that factors in talent and ethics, they must also build the corresponding digital resilience. In other words, they will need a holistic approach of getting IT systems and digital platforms (which host the AI systems) to be ready for the AI era. This holistic approach can be visualised in an AI+DR Impact Matrix (Figure 8), which provides a practical framework to assess an organisation’s readiness in AI and digital resilience (DR). As AI technologies become more pervasive, so do concerns around their misuse and potential for abuse. Geopolitical tensions and ethical considerations are driving the development of regulatory measures aimed at controlling the deployment and impact of AI. These regulations, while necessary, add another layer of complexity for businesses trying to navigate the AI landscape. Companies, particularly multinationals, must now consider not only the technical and operational aspects of AI adoption but also the legal and ethical frameworks that govern its use in the markets they operate in. Not all the AI regulations enacted by countries are restrictive in nature, as shown in Figure 9. In Singapore, the Government has elected to adopt a “twin engine approach to AI regulation” (Yeong, 2024). Rather than implementing broad, sweeping regulations at this time, they have decided to pursue a more balanced approach that equally prioritises the adoption of AI technology and the safeguarding of consumer interests. Regardless, the rise of AI regulation reflects the growing recognition that AI’s influence extends far beyond business operations, impacting society at large. As governments and regulatory bodies introduce new rules and guidelines, businesses will need to adapt quickly to ensure compliance, which could further slow the pace of deep, meaningful AI adoption. AI is undeniably pervasive, with rapid advancements in technology shaping the future of industries worldwide. From the emergence of powerful, multimodal models to the rise of open-source alternatives and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems, the state of AI technology is both impressive and evolving. However, despite these technological leaps, many businesses remain in the early stages of AI adoption, driven by fear of missing out rather than a strategic understanding of AI’s potential. To truly harness AI’s transformative power, businesses must move beyond superficial implementation. This involves not only embracing the latest technological advancements but also developing a deep, strategic approach to AI integration. This means investing in sustainable, use-case-driven solutions, fostering the necessary skills within the organisation, aligning AI strategies with broader business goals, and navigating the increasingly complex regulatory landscape. By addressing these challenges and seizing the opportunities presented by current AI technologies, companies can transition AI from a buzzword to a powerful driver of meaningful, lasting change across industries.     Ding, Y., Fan, W., Ning, L., Wang, S., Li, H., Yin, D., & Li, Q.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  Because of its intrinsic benefits, zero trust is gaining prominence among organisations that seek to fortify their cybersecurity defences. Implementing zero trust enhances an organisation’s overall cybersecurity posture by fostering a resilient infrastructure and cultivating an adaptive work environment. At the heart of a zero trust architecture are dynamic policy decisions and enforcement mechanisms that are contingent on the identity of devices or users. This focus, and the adaptability it enables, allows the system to tailor the level of trust based on contextual factors and reduce the vulnerabilities commonly associated with static security measures.  While organisations recognise the advantages of zero trust, there are internal and external challenges that demand attention. Internally, issues such as defining policies at scale, integrating zero trust into legacy and cyber-physical systems, and acquiring organisational implementation and management skills, pose hurdles. Externally, challenges include the ambiguity caused by the unrealistic claims made by vendors in their marketing of zero trust solutions, and the varying levels of maturity of products labelled as “zero trust”.  This article explains the fundamental principles for zero trust implementation and emphasises the need to address internal and external challenges effectively. It explores the core technologies that are pivotal for enabling zero trust, including access management, analytics for detection and response, security service edge solutions, and macro and micro network segmentation. Furthermore, the article provides insight into the zero trust maturity model defined by the U.S. Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). This model outlines a progressive journey to zero trust implementation across five pillars: identity, devices, networks, applications and workloads, and data. Each stage in the maturity model represents a level of advancement to guide organisations from traditional security approaches to optimal zero trust implementation.  The progress toward zero trust is fuelled by its transformative ability to provide a proactive and adaptive security environment. As organisations navigate the implementation journey, understanding the principles, leveraging core technologies, and aligning with the maturity model can help to maximise the benefits of zero trust and fortify defences against evolving cyber threats.  Interest in zero trust security has been largely driven by government mandates, vendor hype, ransomware attacks, and the needs of increasingly hybrid workforces. According to Gartner, more than 60% of organisations will embrace zero trust as a starting place for security by 2025 .  Zero trust is a transformative security model that challenges the traditional notion of implicit trust within IT architectures. It introduces explicit trusts that are continuously evaluated based on identity and contextual risks. It’s important to note that zero trust is not a standalone security strategy, but rather, a fundamental component within a broader security approach.  In conventional IT environments, security strategies that rely on implicit trust are the norm, and that reliance on implicit trust leads to potential vulnerabilities arising from excessive access. Zero trust addresses these vulnerabilities by replacing implicit trust with a dynamically assessed and explicitly calculated trust model that hinges on identity and context. Establishing a robust identity foundation is imperative for the effective implementation of zero trust.  Zero trust is not confined to networking alone, as its principles can be extended to multiple facets of enterprise system security. Overall, zero trust represents a paradigm shift, as organisations are forced to continuously reassess and adapt their security postures in the face of evolving threats and changing contexts.  The U.S. Department of Commerce’s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) defines zero trust architecture (ZTA) as an approach to cybersecurity that is centred around the principle of “never trust, always verify”. In a zero trust architecture, trust is never assumed for any user, device, or system, even if located within a corporate network. Instead, continuous verification is required of everyone/everything trying to access resources in the network, regardless of its location  .  Key principles of a zero trust architecture, according to NIST, include:   Users and systems are granted the minimum level of access or permissions needed to perform their tasks. Access is restricted based on the principle of least privilege.   Networks are divided into smaller segments and access controls are applied to each segment. This limits lateral movement in case of a security breach.   Continuous monitoring of users, devices, and systems is essential. This involves ongoing verification of identity, device health, and other relevant parameters.   Authentication mechanisms are adjusted based on risk assessments. For example, additional authentication steps may be required for high-risk activities or for unknown devices.   Strict access policies are enforced across the network. These policies are often dynamic and can adapt to changes in the IT environment or threat landscape.   Data is encrypted to protect it from unauthorised access, especially when in transit between users and applications.  A zero trust architecture is designed to address the limitations of traditional perimeter-based security models. It assumes that threats may exist both outside and inside the network and focuses on protecting resources regardless of their locations. This approach aligns with the evolving nature of cybersecurity threats and the need for more robust and adaptive security strategies.  Prevailing IT architectures are fraught with implicit trust, a vulnerability that demands elimination to forestall the abuse of unwarranted access. The zero trust model dismantles implicit trust in favour of a model where trust is continuously assessed, explicitly calculated, and dynamically adaptive, contingent on identity and context. This model serves as a guiding principle for security strategies that not only define the architectural landscape but also enhance security posture and fortify cyber-resilience. Organisations embracing the zero trust mindset and architecture stand to gain two pivotal technical outcomes:   Zero trust principles significantly bolster the resiliency of IT infrastructures. A zero trust network, crafted to operate even in the presence of adversaries, excels at containing and managing incidents. This proactive approach diminishes the likelihood of business-impacting events such as ransomware attacks, data compromises, or malware infections. Consequently, this reduction in risk contributes to the overall robustness and security of the business.   In anticipation of a more hybrid nature of future work, organisations must provide work environments that are more agile, flexible, and adaptable. A zero trust security strategy seamlessly supports remote workers, using both managed and unmanaged devices, remote data (e.g., IaaS), and remote applications (e.g., SaaS). A secure zero trust implementation will enable the realisation of an "anywhere, any time, on any appropriate device" approach that will be crucial for supporting a dynamic and hybrid workforce.  The implementation of zero trust systems within enterprises requires a systematic and strategic approach. The initial step involves identifying specific use cases that will form the basis of an actionable zero trust strategy. For example, initial use cases might focus on reducing exposure to applications and services, mitigating specific threats by restricting the lateral movement of malware, or isolating software supply chains from attack.  Once the use cases are identified, cybersecurity leaders within the organisation need to establish zero trust strategy and requirements. This process involves a comprehensive assessment of the current environment, with a particular focus on existing identity and access management (IAM) technologies and processes. Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the current IAM framework is crucial for determining how zero trust principles can be effectively integrated.  The notion of zero trust emphasises fine-grained, just-in-time, access control for user-to-application and application-to-application communications. This approach uses dynamic policy decisions and enforcement mechanisms based on the identity of the device and/or user and can adapt the level of trust according to contextual factors (Figure 1).  While a zero trust architecture (ZTA) promises enhanced security, both internal and external complications pose challenges to its effective implementation. Internally, organisations often grapple with the need to define policies at scale and to manage the rapid pace of policy changes. Legacy systems and cyber-physical systems, such as those for Internet of Things (IoT), Operational Technology (OT), and industrial control systems (ICS), present hurdles to extending ZTA approaches. Additionally, the concurrent deployment of new technologies and processes requires skills that are either hard to acquire or difficult to develop within the existing workforce. Externally, complications are exacerbated by vendor marketing strategies that often dilute the meaning of “zero trust” and create confusion. Products labelled as “zero trust” also tend to come with higher costs compared to legacy alternatives. Moreover, the maturity and integration levels of products supporting a ZTA vary, and that may impact contextual understanding, management, and reporting.  
 
  Identifying the optimal projects for ZTA implementation is a complex task due to these challenges. It is crucial to recognise that ZTA is not a one-size-fits-all solution available from a single vendor. Instead, a ZTA involves collaboration among multiple technology providers whose products must seamlessly integrate to establish a continuous-identity and context-aware adaptive trust model.  Internal challenges demand a strategic approach to policy definition and adaptation, especially in the face of evolving technologies and legacy systems. Overcoming skills shortages requires comprehensive training programmes and strategic workforce planning. For external challenges, organisations must navigate vendor landscapes carefully and critically evaluate products labelled as "zero trust" to ensure that they align with security needs and budget considerations.  Implementing ZTA requires that cybersecurity leaders prioritise organisational definitions of zero trust and select technology implementations that align with their envisioned future state. Table 1 provides some examples of potential gaps that will need to be addressed to take an organisation from a current state to a desired future state.   Contrary to common misperceptions, transitioning to a ZTA does not necessitate the complete replacement of existing technologies. Many existing tools can support the shift with appropriate configurations. To facilitate this transition, cybersecurity leaders should adhere to the following fundamental principles  :   User account and/or device context, coupled with the criticality of organisational resources, should dictate access rights. This principle emphasises the importance of understanding the context in which users and devices operate to determine the appropriate level of access to sensitive resources.   Access rights enforcement should not be a static process. Continuous runtime assessment of user account and/or device context, along with the resources being accessed, is crucial. This dynamic evaluation ensures that access rights evolve in response to changing contexts, enhancing security by adapting to real-time conditions.  Regardless of physical location, all network communications between organisational resources must be secured. This principle emphasises the need for robust encryption and security measures for data in transit to mitigate the risk of unauthorised access or interception.  By adhering to these basic principles, organisations can lay the foundation for a ZTA. This approach involves a strategic reassessment and reconfiguration of existing technologies to align with the core tenets of zero trust, and ultimately, to the creation of a security model that prioritises continuous verification and dynamic access controls.  It is also important to note that a zero trust strategy must be driven by a business decision that weighs the investment an organisation can/will make versus the benefits that it will accrue from that investment. As organisations improve their capabilities in explaining cybersecurity as a critical business investment, zero trust efforts will be measured against other programme-level security efforts and be viewed as scoped, structured, and proactive as opposed to tactical and reactive.  Implementing a ZTA necessitates the integration of diverse technologies from different vendors. According to Gartner, several key technologies form the core of a future-state ZTA:   At the foundation of a zero trust approach, AM involves establishing, enforcing, and managing runtime access controls for internal and external identities across multiple applications. Implementing continuous adaptive AM, password-less authentication, and a security posture with Identity Threat Detection and Response (ITDR) is pivotal in evolving AM practices and shaping zero trust roadmaps.   In the zero trust evolution of security monitoring and analytics, technologies such as Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR), Network Detection and Response (NDR), and Extended Detection and Response (XDR) play crucial roles. These technologies provide security analytics, incident response, and incident response playbook automation, contributing to context-based access controls in a ZTA.   SSE technology secures access to web, cloud services, and private applications irrespective of user or device location. It enhances security and visibility in Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) environment. SSE, often integrated within a Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) framework, includes Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) capabilities. It offers advanced analytics and trust-scoring for identity- and context-based logical access boundaries around private applications and SaaS services.   Macro-segmentation refers to traditional grouping based on shared characteristics, such as physical location or business importance, and focuses on controlling north/south traffic within a network. It serves as an in-depth defensive component that complements micro-segmentation. Micro-segmentation involves the creation of granular and dynamic policies with the goal of controlling east/west traffic within a macro-segmentation segment. Implemented at the application layer, it enforces a positive security model and reduces the risks associated with lateral movement.  While these technologies form the core of zero trust, there are additional niche technologies supporting zero trust implementations. A robust ZTA extends beyond core technologies to incorporate a layer-of-defence approach that reduces the attack surface and prevents lateral movement. It is crucial to align these technologies with zero trust principles to create a comprehensive security posture. This layered approach provides a resilient defence against evolving cyber threats and ensures a robust and adaptive security framework.  Industry surveys indicate that more than 60% of organisations are either planning or actively implementing a zero trust strategy  . However, Gartner observes that though many clients have a strategy, and are working to implement zero trust technologies, few zero trust implementations can be considered as ‘mature.’ There are several reasons for the nascent state of many ZTA implementations including a lack of interoperability between vendor products, limited scopes of deployment, and a lack of functionality in commercially available products .  The journey towards implementing a zero trust architecture (ZTA) involves a gradual process that unfolds over time, reflecting the dynamic nature of cybersecurity challenges. The U.S. Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has outlined a comprehensive zero trust maturity model that encompasses five pillars: identity, devices, networks, applications and workloads, and data. These pillars are integral to establishing a robust security framework, and each has specific cross-cutting capabilities, including visibility and analytics, automation and orchestration, and governance  .  As organisations progress through the model, the transition from a traditional approach to an optimal ZTA happens over three distinct stages: Initial, Advanced, and Optimal. This staged approach allows for a systematic evolution that allows organisations to distribute costs over time rather than requiring a substantial upfront investment.  In the traditional stage of the CISA model (Figure 2), organisations rely on manual configurations, static security policies, and siloed enforcement, addressing one pillar at a time. The Initial stage of the CISA ZTA maturity model recommends automation, with attributes being assigned and policies configured dynamically. The adoption of least privilege access at this stage results in responsive changes for post-provisioning and greater visibility increases for internal systems.  At the Advanced stage, organisations implement automated controls for lifecycles and configurations across pillars. Centralised visibility and identity control become the norm and policy enforcement integrates seamlessly. Responses are predefined, and changes to least privilege are based on risk and posture assessments, laying the foundation for enterprise-wide awareness.  The Optimal stage is characterised by fully automated lifecycles and assignments, dynamic policies triggered by automated observations, and just-in-time access, and is the zenith of the ZTA journey. Least privilege access becomes dynamic, ensuring assets and dependencies adhere to enterprise-wide thresholds. Cross-pillar interoperability and continuous monitoring contribute to centralised visibility, offering comprehensive situational awareness.  Organisations navigating this maturity model must evaluate each pillar against specific criteria, at each stage, to ensure consistency across the ZTA framework. By aligning pillar maturity with mission needs and the ability to scale across all pillars, organisations can progressively fortify their security postures. This structured approach empowers organisations to adapt to evolving threats and to ultimately achieve an optimal ZTA that provides dynamic, adaptive, and comprehensive security.   Further details of the zero trust maturity model, including key aspects of the pillar-specific functions for each pillar, and across each maturity stage, can be found  .  Zero trust adoption requires cross-organisation collaboration and the involvement of senior leadership, IT personnel, data/system owners, and users. Effective implementation relies on collective engagement to meet design objectives and enhance cybersecurity posture. During ZTA planning, decisions should be guided by factors such as risks, mission, cybersecurity requirements, and operational constraints. The general guide must be tailored based on interactions with external partners, stakeholders, and the service providers involved in ZTA to ensure alignment with organisational dynamics and create a comprehensive approach to security.   As a leading digital and technology service provider, NCS Cyber has a team of highly qualified and experienced cybersecurity professionals with deep domain expertise in zero trust architectures.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  Cryptography is foundational and ubiquitous in data security, yet its importance and complexity are often undervalued. As computing technology becomes increasingly powerful and sophisticated, strong cryptography is more crucial than ever. It can serve as the last line of defence in a zero trust model that relies on multi-layer security to protect an organisation’s most valuable assets. However, implementing cryptography correctly is challenging and requires specialised expertise. This article explores the complexities of cryptography and provides insights on managing the cybersecurity risks associated with its use and management. We emphasise the importance of cryptographic visibility—maintaining an up-to-date inventory of all cryptographic assets—and cryptographic agility – the ability to quickly adapt to new threats by updating or replacing algorithms. These practices are essential components of good cyber hygiene that will ensure robust and adaptable cryptographic security. By focusing on these areas, organisations can better protect their data and maintain the integrity of their systems in an ever-evolving threat landscape.  Cryptography is the practice of securing information by transforming it into an unreadable format that is only decipherable by those who possess a secret key. In the digital world, cryptography is a cornerstone of trust. It acts as the backbone of secure communication and data protection, enabling trust in online interactions, and safeguarding valuable information. More than 96% of current web traffic is protected through cryptography (Figure 1).  Cryptography is essential to cybersecurity in multiple ways. It ensures confidentiality and protects sensitive data from unauthorised access and enables the detection of tampering or alteration of data for integrity verification. It also serves as an authentication mechanism, through the use of digital certificates, for identity verification of users and systems. Furthermore, cryptographic controls are often required for regulatory compliance, with many regulations mandating the implementation of specific cryptographic measures to safeguard data. By fulfilling these roles, cryptography provides a robust foundation for securing information and maintaining trust in digital communications and transactions.  For defence-in-depth, or multi-layer security, cryptography serves as the last line of defence. If a network or system is compromised, strong cryptography is crucial for preventing access to critical assets. It provides resilience against data breaches, ensuring that even if all other security measures fail, the encrypted data remains protected. Cryptography is fundamental to the zero trust model, supporting authentication, enforcing access control policies, and securing data both at rest and in transit. The encryption of sensitive information ensures that unauthorised parties cannot access or decipher the data, and that confidentiality and integrity can be maintained, even in a compromised environment.  Kevin Kenan, in his book Cryptography in the Database: The Last Line of Defence   emphasises the critical role of cryptography in safeguarding databases and positions it as the final layer of defence against potential breaches. As the ‘crown jewels’ of any organisation, databases require an additional layer of protection—strong cryptography—as the ultimate shield for scrambling data into unintelligible ciphertext that becomes useless  if accessed by unauthorised parties.  Effectively implementing cryptography is challenging for a number of reasons:  Given these challenges, getting cryptography right is a not-trivial matter, and managing cryptographic risks is critical.  The improper use and management of cryptography can lead to increased risks of compromising data security or cybersecurity incidents. Such cryptographic risks can emerge from several sources:  An evolving landscape requires constant vigilance and adaptation to maintain robust cryptographic defence. Ongoing updates and revisions to cryptographic practices and systems are essential as the dynamic nature of cryptography means that what is considered secure today may not be secure tomorrow.   Let us take the Transport Layer Protocol (TLS) protocol, today’s most widely used cryptographic protocol, as an example. Figure 2 summarises the evolution of the TLS protocol.  When TLS was first introduced, then called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), it had numerous design flaws and vulnerabilities. SSL 2.0, for example, lacked message integrity protection and relied on weak cryptographic algorithms like RC4 and SSL 3.0, and was susceptible to the POODLE attack, which exploited a fallback mechanism to downgrade secure connections to vulnerable sessions.   To address these issues, stronger cryptographic algorithms were incorporated into TLS 1.2, released in 2008. This version was widely adopted and remained a standard for a considerable period. The most recent version, TLS 1.3, brought significant improvements that focus on both performance and security. TLS 1.3 simplified the handshake process and eliminated outdated cryptographic algorithms, representing a major overhaul.  Some key lessons from the development of TLS over the past two decades include:  At NCS, we have qualified and competent cyber professionals who can assist clients in managing their cryptographic risks. Our assessment methodology aligns with established frameworks such as the NIST Cybersecurity Framework   as well as cybersecurity guidelines provided by local agencies. Central to our approach are two key practices: cryptographic visibility and agility. Cryptographic visibility involves maintaining a comprehensive inventory of cryptographic assets to ensure that all encryption methods and keys are accounted for and monitored. Cryptographic agility ensures quick adaptation to new threats through the updating or replacement of algorithms as required. Together, these practices form a robust strategy to effectively manage and mitigate cryptographic risks.  Having good visibility of what cryptography systems are in place and where and how cryptography is used within an organisation is essential for effective cryptographic risk management. This visibility allows for a comprehensive inventory of cryptographic tools and protocols and ensures that no critical assets are overlooked. It helps organisations to prioritise risks based on the sensitivity and importance of the data and allows for efficient resource allocation to the most critical areas.  As illustrated in Figure 3, cryptography plays a crucial role in telco customer-facing use cases by ensuring secure communication and protecting personal data. TLS encrypts online interactions between customers and telco servers, safeguarding sensitive information such as login credentials and personal data. Telco-provided VPNs enhance security by encrypting all internet traffic from a customer’s device, especially over public Wi-Fi networks. Furthermore, encryption protects customers from the data stored in telco databases and ensures that it remains inaccessible without decryption keys. End-to-end encryption for SMS and voice services ensures that only intended recipients can access the content of messages and calls.  Internally within a telecom operator, cryptography secures the communication links and operational data within its networks. Encryption protects links between base stations and core network gateways, preventing unauthorised access to data such as call metadata and user locations. Encrypted channels safeguard sensitive operational data, such as configuration updates sent to base stations, from interception and manipulation. In the SIM provisioning process, cryptographic keys embedded during manufacturing authenticate and encrypt communications to prevent cloning and fraud. Encrypted data exchanges during SIM distribution secure provisioning information from interception or alteration. Overall, cryptography ensures secure communication, data protection, and operational integrity in the provision of telco services.  A number of tools, both code-based and network-based, can be used to build a comprehensive cryptographic inventory, which is essential for effective risk assessment. This inventory should encompass information associated with all cryptographic assets deployed within or owned by the organisation. These assets may be related to in-house or third-party applications, and internal or external network services. Furthermore, the inventory should specify the lifetime of data that needs to be protected, and the implication to business goals if the data is compromised. By thoroughly cataloguing these elements, organisations can better identify vulnerabilities, prioritise mitigation efforts, and ensure that robust security measures are in place to protect sensitive information and maintain operational integrity.  Once we have good cryptographic visibility, it is crucial to implement processes and mechanisms that can be used to swiftly respond to new cryptographic threats, while minimising the impact on interoperability with existing systems. This will ensure that as new vulnerabilities or advancements in cryptographic techniques arise, the organisation can adapt quickly without compromising security or disrupting operations. Establishing such responsive processes will involve regular monitoring, updating cryptographic protocols, and maintaining flexibility in systems design to integrate new algorithms seamlessly. This proactive approach will help in maintaining a robust security posture against emerging threats.  Cryptographic agility is a key concept in this adaptive approach. Cybersecurity products designed with cryptographic agility can access multiple cryptographic algorithms, allowing system owners to configure the product to use the most suitable algorithms for their specific needs. When existing configuration options are no longer sufficient, these systems have built-in processes to introduce new configuration options that ensure continuous protection. This means that as older algorithms become obsolete or new, more secure, algorithms are developed, the system can be updated with minimal disruption. By incorporating cryptographic agility, organisations can stay ahead of threats and be confident that their security measures evolve in line with technological advancements and emerging vulnerabilities.   Figure 4 shows how a crypto-agile TLS protocol can be configured to adapt swiftly to new threats. Suppose an application within an organisation relies on TLS 1.3, which supports cryptographic algorithms X and Y. If a vulnerability is discovered in algorithm X, rendering TLS 1.3 insecure, the system owner can quickly check the cryptographic inventory to see if the affected algorithm is in use. If it is, there should be a process to promptly disable algorithm X. Consequently, when a new request for a secure connection is made, the system will reject the vulnerable algorithm and instead opt for the secure alternative, algorithm Y. This will ensure continued security without significant disruption to daily operations.  In summary, crypto agility is a crucial DevSecOps activity that involves several key components. First, it requires maintaining an up-to-date inventory of all cryptographic algorithms currently in use to ensure a clear understanding of the organisation’s cryptographic landscape. Second, it involves writing and enforcing crypto replacement policies that define procedures for updating or replacing algorithms when vulnerabilities are discovered or when new, more secure, options become available. Third, a requirement for testing and validating these implementations is essential to ensure that changes do not introduce new vulnerabilities or disrupt existing systems. Finally, continuous monitoring of changes to applications, networks, and data is necessary to detect and respond to potential threats promptly. By integrating these activities, organisations can ensure a robust and adaptable cryptographic security environment that is capable of responding swiftly to emerging threats to fortify their last line of defence.   K.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  For complex engineering projects, adopting a systematic security engineering process is a vital step in developing Cyber Resilient Systems . Not only is it commonly mandated for compliance reasons, but it is also the key enabler for:  However, in many projects, the project teams struggle, often encountering pitfalls that lead to:  Collectively, this can result in significant costs due to wastage. Many of these pitfalls can be avoided by working with an experienced Operational Technology (OT) Security team that can skillfully lead and help stakeholders navigate the complexities. This paper highlights the six important areas for OT Security teams supporting complex engineering projects to consider, with examples drawn from the real-life delivery of a project that involved fabricating a new substation for an offshore wind farm.    We cannot overemphasise the importance of having a systematic process and a clear understanding of its requirements. This involves not only a thorough grasp of cybersecurity activities, but also the crucial integration of these activities and considerations into the overarching systems engineering and project processes.  In the context of critical systems or systems delivery in highly regulated industries, it is typically mandatory to establish a security programme that incorporates lifecycle process best practices. Applicable highly regulated industries include Aviation, Maritime, Land Transport & Rail, Healthcare, Power & Utilities, Oil & Gas, and Critical Information Infrastructure.  Various publications discuss compliance requirements or provide guidance on security programmes and best practices . While general concepts and best practices are usually consistent across these publications, the level of detail on specific subtopics may differ. In our experience, PD CLC/TS 50701, the cybersecurity standard for rail applications, provides the clearest guidance on executing a robust security programme. Although it is intended for rail systems, it is aligned with ISA/IEC 62443, making it relevant and applicable across various industries. The process described in PD CLC/TS 50701 is also largely consistent with the process our team applies for our consultancy projects.  The PD CLC/TS 50701 standard provides detailed elaboration on the cybersecurity activities and the integration of cybersecurity with other project activities and deliverables across the 13 lifecycle phases (0-12), aligned with EN50126 Railway Applications – The Specification and Demonstration of Reliability, Availability, Maintainability and Safety (RAMS). Table 1 shows details extracted from PD CLC/TS 50701 as a subset of these lifecycle phases for illustration  purposes.  We recommend reading the relevant chapters of the original publication for complete details. Appendix B: ‘Example Process Flowchart for Security and Safety Co-engineering’ further illustrates the process for security and safety co-engineering.  At the beginning of an advanced system engineering project, the OT Security team may face confusion about how to approach the project. Team members may be aware of some compliance standards, such as IEC 62443, ISO 21434, CLC/TS 50701, or DO-326, and specific functional requirements like central logging, continuous monitoring, and equipment patching. Additionally, the project may require various documentation deliverables, such as an OT Security management plan, vendor management plan, account management policy, and vulnerability management procedure.  However, the initial list of standards provided may not cover the full scope of necessary compliance. For instance, Singapore regulations mandate that Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) systems comply with CCOP, healthcare systems handling patient data may be subject to HIPAA, and airborne systems requiring airworthiness certification may need to adhere to standards like DO-178. Therefore, relying solely on the standards guidance provided by project stakeholders may result in incomplete adherence to the complete regulatory and standards requirements.  Meeting functional requirements such as central logging impacts the entire system development lifecycle. This necessitates prioritising devices with logging capabilities and built-in log exportation features, which must be validated throughout the development process. To ensure that these activities are properly executed, adopting a suitable framework such as the approach described in NIST SP 800-160 is essential. Additionally, other guidelines and publications may be needed to develop specific documentation deliverables such as an account management policy.  The OT Security team should proactively conduct its own research and assessments to determine the full suite of applicable regulations, standards, and publications. Early discussions with project stakeholders are crucial to ensure that all requirements are identified and understood. Documenting this information in relevant management plans, such as the OT Security management plan and vendor management plan, is essential for effective information flow and alignment throughout the project.  Understanding the contexts—for stakeholders, systems, and roles—is crucial for successful planning and project execution in an advanced systems engineering project. This comprehensive understanding lays the foundation for effective planning and ensures that all aspects of the project are well-coordinated and aligned with the goals.  The system context, including early indicators from risk assessments, is vital for planning and assessing the system's criticality. Before conducting detailed risk assessments, initial judgments can be made based on the system's intended function, asset composition, interactions with other systems, communication interfaces, and the data traversing these interfaces. These early insights help in shaping the security strategy and expected efforts for the system.  In such projects, the OT Security team will likely interface with multiple stakeholders, including regulators, asset owners, and system operators. For systems in highly regulated domains, or requiring external certifications, stakeholders may also include regulators or external compliance/certification bodies. Security and the Information Security Management System (ISMS) considerations impact most stakeholders. Planning and strategy activities that lead to deliverables like plans and procedures require an understanding of these stakeholders' contexts to define their roles and responsibilities within the ISMS framework effectively.  As the subject matter experts, the OT Security team is expected to provide advice to other stakeholders on project efforts, activities, and various scenarios. Its expertise is crucial for guiding stakeholders through the planning process, helping them understand the projected efforts and activities affecting their work streams, and advising on the next steps for different scenarios, such as seeking deviations or waivers and determining endorsements. A deep understanding of the context is essential for performing this advisory role professionally.  Security-related activities and deliverables cannot be accomplished without close participation and input from technical subject experts and project sub-teams. Security practitioners must be able to play an active role to lead the process, as they cannot rely on non-security-trained stakeholders to know or anticipate the required information or to document it in a format directly relevant to security activities. Effective and meaningful discussions and clarifications are often necessary to bridge this gap.  Security practitioners should leverage non-security resources to gain the initial context needed to lead meaningful discussions, assessments, and surveys. In our experience, the master document list (or master document register) of the project is an excellent starting point. It provides insights into the information that will be documented throughout the project lifecycle, and when this information will become available.  Wiring construction diagrams or electrical connection diagrams are valuable references for understanding the expected network and communication interfaces between components. We have used information from these documents to create system network diagrams and data flow diagrams for threat modelling. Additionally, documents on functional safety assessments and failure analysis are useful for understanding the functional criticality of system components and the corresponding impact of failures. These documents provide meaningful knowledge that is essential for performing cybersecurity risk assessments.  Implementing security controls involves the act of balancing the adequacy of protection for the system against the cost of implementing those security controls. A risk-based approach towards implementation will allow adequate security controls while also ensuring the distribution of budget across the system based on needs and necessity.   In our experience, IEC 62443-3-3 is a great reference that provides a comprehensive list of security controls to be considered, and a breakdown of controls based on the severity level of the system components. When planning the security controls to implement, planners can reference the publication as a good starting point, even for projects that do not mandate IEC 62443 compliance.  Engineering cyber resilient OT systems requires meticulous planning, a thorough understanding of the system and stakeholder contexts, and effective collaboration among various teams. The OT Security team plays a pivotal role in guiding stakeholders and ensuring that security requirements are well-integrated into a project’s broader objectives. They undertake six main tasks: understanding compliance requirements, engaging stakeholders, conducting risk assessments, implementing security controls, ensuring continuous monitoring, and facilitating patch management. By leveraging non-security resources and integrating early risk assessment indicators, the team can develop a comprehensive security strategy that aligns with a project’s goals and lifecycle. This proactive and context-driven approach enhances the security posture, facilitates efficient resource use, and ensures that security considerations are seamlessly incorporated into the system development process.  Share this article on: Get the full report from NCS' leading experts.

                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  Phishing, an increasingly complex cyber threat, affects various communication channels beyond emails, such as texts and social media.  These attacks, aimed at stealing personal data or financial fraud, use sophisticated social engineering, challenging traditional firewall defences. Phishing's global impact, financial damages, and targeted nature necessitate advanced solutions.  This white paper introduces a novel AI-based approach using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and computer vision to counter these evolving cyber threats.  Phishing attacks have become a prominent threat globally and consistently rank among the top cybersecurity concerns in numerous reports. They cause significant financial losses annually. The FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Centre reports more than US$1.8 billion was lost in the United States in 2021 due to business email compromise (BEC) scams alone. The frequency and sophistication of phishing attacks has been increasing, with cybercriminals employing more advanced methods to evade detection.  Spear-phishing attacks are highly targeted attempts where cybercriminals customise their deceptive messages to specific individuals or organisations. These attacks are more successful because they often use personal information to create a semblance of legitimacy.  Certain sectors, notably finance, healthcare, and government, are more vulnerable to phishing attacks due to the sensitive nature of the data they manage.  Current phishing detection solutions range from simple rule-based heuristics to advanced machine learning and AI-based methods. These solutions include user behaviour monitoring, the sandboxing of suspicious links or attachments, URL analysis using blacklists and reputation databases, and real-time URL scanning. Multiple deep learning models, including computer vision and NLP, can be combined to create a novel, comprehensive, anti-phishing solution.  Around 4,100 phishing attempts were reported to the Singapore Cyber Emergency Response Team (SingCERT) in 2023, less than half of what was reported in 2022. Notwithstanding the decline, the number of phishing attempts was still about 30% higher than that in 2021.  Bad actors are constantly refining their phishing strategies to bypass conventional detection methods. They often use URL shortening services to obscure malicious links and create webpages that are visually indistinguishable from legitimate sites.  Advanced phishing schemes also use image-based text to avoid text-based detection and employ homograph attacks to trick users into visiting harmful websites.  In response to the sophisticated and evolving nature of phishing attacks, we have developed a state-of-the-art detection system that synergises deep learning models, including computer vision and NLP. Our system has an in-depth understanding of phishing markers and operates on a proactive knowledge base that is continuously updated with the latest information on popular global websites, with a particular focus on Singapore.  In Table 1, we evaluated the features included with Google Safe Browsing, Microsoft Office 365, and other readily available commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) solutions in the market, and compared those to our solution:  Our system compares webpages that are suspected of being fraudulent to a list of known, legitimate, brand webpages. This process helps us identify instances where a webpage appears very similar to a legitimate brand's website but uses a different domain. When we detect such a similarity, we flag the webpage as a phishing site that is targeting the brand it resembles.  Our system meticulously compares suspicious webpages with an extensive list of legitimate brand webpages, identifying deceptive sites that mimic the appearance of authentic brands but operate under different domains.  We utilise advanced computer vision algorithms to analyse webpage screenshots and logos. This analysis is instrumental in detecting phishing sites that imitate the visual design of legitimate brands and enhances our ability to identify potential threats accurately.  Complementing our computer vision capabilities, we employ NLP to extract and analyse information from the HTML source code of webpages. This process helps us to identify the indicative linguistic patterns and cues of phishing attempts.  As depicted in Figure 1, our detection system incorporates a suite of deep learning models, enabling us to detect sophisticated phishing attempts that elude traditional detection methods. We analyse multiple elements, including webpage layout, logos, and textual content, to ensure a comprehensive approach to phishing detection.  Our multi-model approach includes several critical components:  : Analyses webpage layouts for inconsistencies and anomalies that are characteristic of phishing sites : Compares logos against known brands to detect counterfeit usage  : Scrutinises domains to identify suspicious or deceptive URLs  : Identifies pages designed to capture sensitive information  A key feature of our system is its proactive knowledge base, which serves several essential functions:  Continuous updates: Houses and continuously updates current information on popular websites globally  Focus on Singapore and government sites: Specifically tracks Singaporean websites and government portals for enhanced local protection  Semi-automatic knowledge retrieval: Gathers information from multiple sources, including the Google Image API and Wikidata Extractor to ensure a comprehensive and up-to-date database  Our AI-powered approach offers several advantages over standard phishing detection solutions:  : The combination of computer vision and NLP enables us to detect phishing sites accurately, even when fraudsters employ advanced tactics to mimic legitimate brands. In testing using the OpenPhish and Tranco datasets, our solution received an F1 score of 89%, demonstrating the robustness of our approach. Moreover, our model demonstrated exceptional precision, reaching 97.1%, which indicates a low false positive rate. Additionally, our experiment showed a recall rate of 82.3%, indicating our ability to effectively detect malicious websites. These outcomes highlight the efficacy of our methodology in enhancing cybersecurity measures and identifying phishing threats.  : As phishing techniques continue to evolve, our solution can be updated to recognise new patterns and trends to ensure ongoing protection against emerging threats.  : By employing multiple detection techniques, we reduce the likelihood of false positives and minimise disruptions to legitimate web traffic.  : The financial services, government, and logistics sectors are frequent targets of phishing attacks, and can benefit greatly from our advanced detection system.  Phishing attacks are a persistent problem for individuals and organisations alike. The tactics employed by malicious actors are constantly evolving, making it difficult to rely on traditional rule-based firewall defences. Our AI-powered phishing detection solution leverages advanced NLP and computer vision techniques to provide a more robust defence against these malicious tactics.  Our solution compares suspicious webpages to a database of legitimate brand sites, analyses visual elements, and extracts information from HTML source code to deliver enhanced detection accuracy, adaptability, and protection for targeted sectors. We believe our approach represents a significant step forward in the ongoing battle against phishing attacks, particularly in a world where cyber threats are constantly changing.  Singapore Cyber Landscape.

                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  5G networks promise to bring significant improvements over 4G including faster data rates, ultra-low latency, and massive device connectivity. They also support new capabilities such as network slicing and edge computing to enable multiple 5G services. These 5G networks are designed with improved security features based on cybersecurity principles such as ‘defence-in-depth’, ‘zero trust architecture’, and ‘secure by design’. However, the complexity that comes with 5G networks inadvertently increases the attack surface and adds security risks for 5G network operators and users. The key challenge that enterprises face today is how to implement the security required to protect their 5G services against cyber threats without impacting the operational benefits of the 5G network.   To address this challenge, NCS worked with the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA), a part of the Prime Minister’s Office that is managed by the Ministry of Communications and Information, to conduct a comprehensive study on how available cybersecurity solutions could impact the effectiveness and performance of the User Equipment (UE) deployed within 5G networks. As 5G technology is still relatively new, there are no established guidelines to study the performance impact of the cybersecurity solutions on the UE in 5G networks. NCS developed the following evaluation framework to address this need:   The use cases for the NCS study were selected after consultation with stakeholders to identify cases that cover a range of 5G applications and performance metrics. These use cases are as follows:  The diagram below shows how the use cases were set up in the 5G testbed and Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) over a 5G network.  The performance metrics selected for the study were throughput, latency, battery consumption, CPU usage, and memory usage. Metric selection was based on the ability to assess impact on operations (i.e., an increase in latency and battery consumption may impact performance of a teleoperations application over 5G).  For testing purposes, all UE deployed in the use cases should ideally be 5G-native to ensure end-to-end secure communication over the 5G network. If the UE deployed cannot be 5G-native (due to device limitations), it should be securely connected, either wired or wirelessly, to 5G Customer Premise Equipment (CPE) or other 5G devices to ensure secure end-to-end connectivity to the 5G network.  To assess the impact on operations, at each security level, across use cases, the required security features at each level must first be defined so that they can be implemented on the UE. The hypothesis is that the performance impact is related to the number of security features and the security settings used. By way of illustration, a UE should be expected to have high CPU usage if a large number of security features, with high security settings, is used.  As there is no generally agreed framework for defining these security features at different security levels, established 5G cybersecurity standards such as those provided by the U.S. National Institute of Standards (NIST) and the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) were used as the basis for selecting the relevant security features and mapping those features across different security levels. For instance, there is no agreement on the security features required for a ‘baseline security’ level, while a ‘low security’ level must have the minimum number of security features and lowest security settings (e.g., AES-128) required to secure the UE in the 5G network. A ‘high security’ level will have all security features enabled and set to the highest security settings (e.g., AES-256) on the UE.  All security features should be available within the identified cybersecurity solution to ensure an end-to-end performance evaluation, however, as a practical matter, there is no cybersecurity solution that can fully cover all security features. For instance, some security features may not be available due to factors such as an unsupported device operating system or a lack of market demand for the security feature. As such, there is a need to identify and address these cybersecurity gaps through a gap analysis.  The data collected for assessing performance metrics should be automated, to the extent possible, using data logging to minimise human error and workloads. Automation can be achieved through installing agents within the UE or via simple written codes that log data during measurement and retrieve the data after the measurement is completed. Data formats should be standardised to support data processing and analysis. Measurement should be performed as close to the application layer as possible, and live traffic from the application should be used for measurement to ensure the most accurate representation of the user experience during operation.  Multiple runs should be conducted to collect as much data as possible to derive the average, upper limit, and lower limit of the performance metric. The average can be used to determine the typical value of the performance metric, and the upper and lower limits will determine the spread of the performance metric.  After data is collected and processed for the performance metrics measured in each of the use cases based on different security levels, the results of the performance metrics at low to high security levels can be compared against the baseline security level to determine the percentage change in the performance metrics. For instance, a 50% increase in latency translates to a two-fold increase in response time, and a 50% increase in battery consumption means that the battery-operated device can last only half as long. This will provide a comprehensive and quantitative assessment of the operational impact for each use case.  After the assessment of impact to operations is completed, a gap analysis should be conducted to compare the available security features used during the study versus the required security features. This will help to identify the gaps in the security features for 5G devices and point to recommendations, such as development of security features, to bridge the gaps. The key findings from the gap analysis performed by NCS in its study are as follows:  NCS possesses the necessary skills, resources, and capabilities to address the 5G cybersecurity gaps and further advance 5G cybersecurity solutions in the industry. These include:  5G capabilities such as network slicing are still evolving. There is a need to stay current on the latest 5G cybersecurity technical solutions that will protect critical 5G systems and services against emerging threats. At the same time, there is also a need for a balance between meeting cybersecurity needs and ensuring minimal impact to the performance of 5G services.  This evaluation framework provides a systematic approach to validating the most suitable security configurations that will maximise 5G benefits and minimise impact to operations, based on use case. At the same time, it also allows enterprises to identify 5G cybersecurity gaps, so that system integrators, such as NCS, can develop the required security features to meet the enterprise’s operational and security requirements.  Cybersecurity Agency of Singapore.

Businesses that fail to prepare for quantum-safe security may face significant risks, including data breaches and a loss of competitive advantage. This summary highlights the essential steps and benefits of transitioning to quantum-safe practices to ensure that your business remains secure, competitive, and future-proof.  Our world depends on digital infrastructure and digital communications – all of which inherently rely on cryptography to ensure trust. Cryptographic technologies are used throughout governments and enterprises across a variety of industries, to authenticate sources and protect the confidentiality and integrity of the information that we communicate and store. Cryptographic technologies include a broad range of protocols, schemes, and infrastructures.  Trust is at risk as asymmetric cryptography is likely to be broken when a Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computer (CRQC) becomes available. This risk extends to symmetric cryptography, which will not be directly impacted, but will require new strategies for mitigation as well. As quantum computing advances, organisations face the need to protect their sensitive data from potential vulnerabilities.  The quantum computing era will unfold over time, but the need for quantum-safe solutions is immediate. The strategic planning, preparation, and remediation effort required to support crypto systems, even pre-quantum computing, can require several years because of the complexity involved. Business, technology, and security leaders face an urgent need to develop quantum-safe strategies and quantum-computing roadmaps now.  The IT landscape has become increasingly complex over the years. This landscape is composed of many components including internally developed digital applications, IT capabilities inherited through acquisitions, third party software products and SaaS, and services consumed from cloud providers. The scope of technology that organisations need to upgrade to become quantum-safe, or remediated to use quantum-safe cryptography, is significant. As a result, it is not unreasonable to anticipate several years of effort for an enterprise to become quantum-safe.  Developing quantum-safe cryptography capabilities is crucial to maintaining data security and integrity for critical applications. This includes developing and applying cryptographic agility approaches to switch between multiple cryptographic primitives without making any major changes to infrastructure to ensure a rapid response to any cryptographic threat.  Cryptographic agility requires more than just an inventory of cryptographic assets and usage. It requires having the relevant information, at the right time, in the right place, with the right governance. A programmatic and iterative quantum-safe programme, developed in collaboration with stakeholders, will provide a structured approach to implementing quantum-safe solutions that adapt to emerging threats and continuously improve overall security.  The scope of what needs to be upgraded to be quantum-safe or remediated to use post-quantum cryptography (PQC), is significant. The journey to a quantum-safe future must be well planned and incrementally executed based on business and technical priorities and several other critical considerations. The following provides an overview of critical steps to consider on the journey to a quantum-safe future:  
	The first step is to ensure a comprehensive understanding of cryptography usage across the organisation. This can be achieved by developing an inventory of both the static and dynamic view of cryptography usage. The scanning of cryptography usage in custom applications used within an organisation provides a static view, and scanning networks for cryptography calls provides a dynamic view of cryptography usage. This comprehensive inventory of cryptography usage is best represented in a standard form such as a Cryptography Bill of Materials (CBOM).  
	Having a comprehensive inventory is necessary but not especially useful from a planning perspective. It is critical that the ‘crown jewels’ (i.e., the most critical data and assets with your organisation) are identified and safeguarded first. This can be achieved by classifying all assets within the organisation, based on both business and technical importance, and weighing the criticality of each asset. The resulting prioritised view of the asset landscape can then be used to develop a transformation plan or roadmap.  The world is on the cusp of another computer revolution that will be driven by the convergence of powerful technologies, chief among which are high-performance computing, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and quantum computing. Quantum computing is not simply a faster way of doing what today’s computers do – it is a fundamentally different approach that promises to solve problems that classical computing can never realistically solve. It holds the promise to help humanity confront important challenges, from solving long-standing questions in science, to overcoming obstacles in improving industrial efficiency. Working in conjunction with classical computers and cloud-based architectures, quantum computers could even be the answer to problems we haven’t yet dreamed of. The benefits to society and the economic opportunities are potentially limitless.  In the case of quantum computing, the theme of the past few decades has been the emergence and establishment of this innovative technology. The quantum community has been focused on laying the groundwork: experimenting with quantum hardware, devising use cases, and educating people on how to use quantum computers, while running experiments benchmarking devices. Recently, IBM made quantum computing real.  A June 2023 paper by IBM and UC Berkeley outlines a path toward useful quantum computing.Read here for new insights into how we demonstrated that quantum computers could run circuits beyond the reach of brute-force classical simulations. For the first time, IBM has hardware and software capable of executing quantum circuits with no known a priori answer at a scale of 100 qubits and 3,000 gates. Quantum is now a computational tool, and what makes us most excited is that we can start to advance science in fields beyond quantum computing itself. It is clear that a heterogeneous computing architecture consisting of scalable and parallel circuit execution and advanced classical computation is required. This has culminated in IBM’s vision for high-performance systems for the future: quantum-centric supercomputing (IBM Debuts Next-Generation Quantum Processor & IBM Quantum System Two, Extends Roadmap to Advance Era of Quantum Utility). The security of most standard algorithms relies on extremely difficult mathematical problems that take years to solve with current computers. Modern public-key encryption protocols are satisfactory for protecting against most of the technological tools at the disposal of today’s threat actors. However, that won’t last. Quantum computers will be capable of breaking these math-based systems in a matter of seconds. In addition, threat actors are now harvesting large quantities of encrypted data and storing it until they can break the encryption keys using quantum computing. Data that is encrypted today is vulnerable to decryption tomorrow.  
When large-scale quantum computers are built, they will be capable of breaking many of the current public-key cryptography systems. Global funding for quantum computing start-ups increased by 13.5% last year, to $1.1 billion. According to  , China plans to invest $15.3 billion in the industry, and the European Union has set aside $7.2 billion for investment. Without significant preparation for moving to post-quantum cryptography, quantum computers in the wrong hands could significantly compromise the privacy and security of the digital communications that the world increasingly relies on.  The question of when cryptography will be broken by quantum computing is unfortunate as it implicitly frames the threat as some time in the future, when in reality, the threat exists today, but the impact will only be felt in the future. Data that is considered securely protected today has already been lost to a future quantum adversary if it has been stolen or harvested. All data, past, present, and future, that is not protected using quantum-safe security, is at risk, and the longer we postpone the migration to quantum-safe standards, the more data there will be that is at risk.  Our experience makes it clear that there will not be a one-size-fits-all strategy when it comes to migrating to quantum-safe security. Given the long-term nature of the threat, and the dynamic environment surrounding quantum computing, it is also clear that a cryptographic strategy needs to consider multiple time frames address potential step improvements in quantum technology development. Governments have a role to play. To supplement the private sector’s engagement in standards development, governments need to accelerate investment in, and promote the adoption of, quantum-safe cryptographic solutions that can safeguard data now and long into the future.  The threat of Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computers (CRQC) is significant, but the timeline for when that threat will be realised is unknown. How can an organisation quantify the risk of CRQCs when they don’t yet exist? The immediate best practice suggests creating several scenarios of the risk of a quantum threat to a specific asset, with some of these scenarios deemed as “more likely” than others.  The argument for starting to address the threat that quantum computers will pose to existing security systems now, is based on the following considerations:  Cryptographic technologies are integrated into most of the digital products commonly used by organisations to run their daily operations.  Some of the applications and systems used in the infrastructure within the energy, transportation, finance, and government sectors have product lifetimes of 15 to 30 years, and requirements for data protection and privacy are even longer.  The time needed to migrate installed cryptographic technologies (e.g., SHA1) to something newer is usually measured in years.  The cryptographic systems that organisations will need to migrate to new “quantum-safe” cryptography will be numerous.  Most organisations have no clear view of the cryptographic technologies used in IT operations and this will make it difficult to discover, and then prioritise, the systems to be upgraded to post-quantum cryptography.  The World Economic Forum (WEF) recently published a set of guiding principles that outline the steps that organisations can take to become quantum cyber-ready   in preparation for a quantum-secure economy. The guidelines also highlight the importance of a cohesive global and cross-border approach to governing quantum that includes involving business stakeholders and experts from business, governments, regulators, and academic institutions. However, as organisations vary in size, industry, and maturity, there is no single approach or strategy that serves as a one-size-fits-all solution.   We outline five key guiding principles that any organisation should consider as it starts to prepare for the transition to quantum-safe security.  In contemplating the potential impact of quantum computing on the digital landscape, it is crucial to adopt a forward-thinking perspective that extends beyond the technology’s current developmental stage. Quantum computing holds transformative potential, yet remains an active area of research, with scientists exploring more reliable and scalable methods. Attempting to predict precisely when quantum computers will break existing encryption technology is challenging, so strategic preparation efforts should be decoupled from specific development timelines. Relying solely on projected quantum computing evolution can create a false sense of security. Instead, organisations should focus on building a robust cybersecurity foundation, with quantum-resistant algorithms, irrespective of the uncertain future arrival of quantum computers. This approach involves developing cryptographic strategies that are not time-dependent, embrace post-quantum cryptography (PQC), and continuously enhance security. By building in adaptability and resilience, organisations can proactively secure digital assets in preparation for the full realisation of quantum computing.  Preparing for the imminent era of quantum computing requires organisations to proactively strengthen their cybersecurity defences. A foundational step in this process is conducting a thorough cryptography inventory and assessment, and this is especially crucial for entities that safeguard data requiring prolonged protection. The scrutinisation of cryptographic infrastructure allows organisations to identify vulnerabilities and bolster defences against quantum computing threats. This preparatory phase involves the identification of assets and systems that rely on cryptography, and emphasis should be placed on those using vulnerable algorithms such as RSA and ECC. Prioritisation is critical. Organisations should categorise systems based on data criticality to strategically allocate resources. Evaluating the potential impact of transitioning to quantum-resistant algorithms ensures a seamless integration without compromising operational efficiency. This proactive approach positions organisations to navigate the challenges posed by quantum computing effectively.  Establishing quantum-safe security requires a meticulous approach and the active involvement of senior executives in the establishment and enforcement of a robust governance structure. A dedicated governance team should oversee the entire process to ensure alignment with organisational goals. This involves developing a quantum-safe roadmap which is in sync with quantum risk assessments and the organisation’s risk appetite.   Moreover, integrating quantum risk into the existing cybersecurity operating model fortifies defences against emerging threats. Designating cryptographic ‘champions’ within the organisation will help to socialise the potential impact of quantum risk and drive the implementation of quantum security plans. In essence, effective governance will form the foundation for successful quantum security projects by instituting robust structures and mandates that ensure clear direction and accountability throughout the quantum-safe transition.  In enhancing cybersecurity against the uncertainties introduced by quantum computing, a prudent and conservative approach is essential. We advocate a strategy embracing a hybrid approach that strategically combines classical and quantum-safe cryptographic algorithms. A nuanced strategy will include the consideration that today’s quantum-safe algorithms may encounter future challenges from computing advancements or unforeseen weaknesses, as has often been the case throughout the history of cryptography. By adopting a multi-layered defence mechanism through a hybrid approach and not relying solely on the resilience of a single cryptographic algorithm, organisations can more efficiently fortify their security postures. This approach may involve combining classical and quantum-safe algorithms, or the integration of multiple quantum-safe algorithms that have distinct properties. A forward-looking strategy should emphasise adaptability and robustness and reflect a commitment to proactive security measures that are diverse and redundant.  In the pursuit of quantum-safe security, continuous capability development is crucial for organisations seeking a proactive and adaptive transition. This involves conducting small-scale pilots to validate PQC solutions in real-world scenarios to assess performance, compatibility, and integration challenges. These pilots will yield valuable data and feedback that will inform and enhance the overall migration strategy. Simultaneously, employee education should play a leading role in raising awareness about quantum computing risks, and the necessity for migration. Training programmes will empower workforces with knowledge and the skills to securely use and manage quantum-safe systems, while helping to establish a culture of cybersecurity awareness. Continuous monitoring of PQC implementations will ensure the ongoing identification of vulnerabilities and performance issues that will be crucial for staying ahead of the evolving quantum threat landscape. The governance team should remain agile and adapt security measures based on emerging challenges and insights gained through ongoing monitoring. Regular tracking of standardisation efforts by organisations like NIST and ETSI will solidify the organisation’s commitment to quantum-safe security and ensure alignment with industry best practices and standards. Through these multifaceted efforts, organisations can fortify their capabilities and readiness to navigate the quantum era with resilience and foresight.  Adopting quantum-safe practices isn't just about security; it's a strategic business move. In this subsection, we translate technical principles into business strategies and detail how being ‘quantum-safe’ can be a unique selling point and enhance customer trust.  Our experience shows that the journey to ‘quantum-safe’ must be well planned and incrementally executed based on a number of considerations including business and technical priorities. An effective quantum-safe approach combines technology with first-step guidance to prioritise quantum-safe initiatives, and to assess organisational risk, IT strategy, supply-chain dependencies, and ecosystem operations. Core to this approach is the creation of cryptographic inventories as well as corresponding risk and governance plans. Quantum-safe migration is a multi-step process requiring both operations and cryptographic experience. Alignment with broader business transformation efforts is another dimension for effective planning across this multi-year initiative. External factors involving regulatory agencies, standards bodies, and ecosystem partners must also be considered.  The IBM Quantum Safe approach combines first-step guidance for prioritisation with IBM Quantum Safe technology that is tailored to meet clients’ organisational risk, IT strategy, supply-chain dependency, and ecosystem operational objectives. The IBM Quantum Safe offering extends to include capabilities designed to provide a better understanding of applications and network operations. The overall approach supports a quantum-safe change programme through the creation of cryptographic inventories and corresponding risk and governance plans.   There are two main elements:   Services designed to enable clients to initiate a quantum-safe transformation programme and prepare to fund and scale the programme across the organisation. The IBM Quantum Safe programme establishes an approach to assess the requirements to transition to quantum-safe cryptography and creates a plan for adoption. The approach includes clear phases and outcomes via agile information collection methods with delivery dependencies and parallel activities.  Designed to guide clients through initial pilots to demonstrate the ability to accelerate the transition to quantum-safe cryptography, accelerate the remediation of applications within the enterprise, and establish a programme for full-scale deployment.  IBM Quantum Safe technology offers a comprehensive set of capabilities and approaches, combined with deep expertise, to help plan and execute a migration to quantum-safe cryptography. Quantum cyber resilience can be carried out over three phases—Discover, Observe, and Transform—each powered by IBM Quantum Safe technology:   can enable organisations to scan source and object code to locate cryptographic assets, dependencies, and vulnerabilities to build a CBOM. This allows teams to view and aggregate potential risks into one central location.   enables the creation of a dynamic or operational view of cryptographic inventory to guide remediation and analyses cryptographic posture and compliance to prioritise risks. Quantum Safe Advisor performs an enterprise-wide analysis of your cryptography and builds a comprehensive cryptographic inventory that details the types and locations of your cryptographic instances, the relationships between assets and data flows, and potential vulnerabilities to quantum technology.   enables organisations to deploy and test best-practice-based quantum-safe remediation patterns to understand the potential impact on systems and assets as they prepare to deploy quantum-safe solutions. Remediator helps organisations to create an architecture for seamlessly upgrading cryptographic infrastructure to become quantum-safe.  There are multiple existing cybersecurity risk management guidelines and frameworks that have been widely adopted by organisations, such as the following:  : Risk Management Framework (RFM) for information systems and organisations: A system life cycle approach for security and privacy .   for improving critical infrastructure cybersecurity .   Information security, cybersecurity and privacy protection – Information security management systems    : Information security, cybersecurity and privacy protection – Guidance on managing information security risks  .  These standards share a common focus on effective risk management in information security, emphasising a systematic approach to comprehensively identify, assess, and manage risks. They advocate continuous monitoring, assessment, and improvement to address evolving cybersecurity threats, considering technical aspects, governance, processes, and human factors.  In Singapore, the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) aims to protect individuals' personal data by establishing guidelines for its collection, use, and disclosure. Organisations must implement reasonable security arrangements to safeguard personal data from unauthorised access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. Cryptography plays a crucial role in cybersecurity risk management in ensuring data confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity.  For example, encryption is used to secure data at rest, in transit, and during processing to mitigate the risk of data breaches and unauthorised disclosures, in alignment with PDPA requirements.  Despite their widespread adoption, current risk management frameworks lack provisions for quantum-safe security and reveal gaps that must be addressed. Consideration of quantum risks should be integrated into existing risk assessment processes. Organisations must focus on evaluating the longevity of the data that supports critical applications. For prolonged data protection, there is a pressing need to introduce additional mitigating controls. Quantum computing threats pose risks to sensitive health and financial data, compromise the confidentiality of communications, challenge the integrity of digital documents, and threaten cryptocurrencies.  The emergence of ‘harvest now, decrypt later’ tactics underscores the urgency for organisations to fortify their cybersecurity measures against quantum advancements. Proactive adjustments to risk management strategies are crucial to navigate evolving threats and ensure the resilience of information security frameworks in the face of quantum challenges.  In what follows, we give an overview of two examples of quantum risk assessment frameworks which have been published within the quantum-safe community: Mosca’s Quantum Risk Assessment (QRA)   and Crypto Agility Risk Assessment Framework (CARAF)  . Moreover, we highlight the limitations of the frameworks.  uses a time-based approach to define risk that is dependent on when migration to a quantum-safe state begins and considers ‘harvest now, decrypt later’ attacks. The methodology for the framework has been adapted from the six stages for conducting a risk assessment outlined in the NIST Cybersecurity Framework  .  Mosca’s ‘x, y, z’ quantum risk model focuses on the dimensions of the impact of quantum computing. The ‘x’ parameter represents the lifetime of assets (the number of years encryption must be secure). The ‘y’ parameter indicates the time required to migrate to a quantum-safe state (the number of years required to bring current IT infrastructure to a quantum-safe state). The ‘z’ parameter considers the time until current cyber defences collapse in the face of threat actors with access to quantum technology (the number of years before a large-scale quantum computer is built). Based on these parameters, organisations can assess the urgency and potential consequences of quantum threats as a guide for the development of strategic and timely responses that ensure the security of their cryptographic systems.   builds on Mosca's QRA by specifically addressing cryptographic agility. Cryptographic agility involves the swift replacement of vulnerable cryptographic primitives, algorithms, and protocols with more secure alternatives. The conventional process of transitioning from one cryptographic solution to another can be time-consuming and can potentially leave organisations exposed to security risks during the transition period.  The CARAF framework can be used to systematically analyse and assess the risks arising from the absence of cryptographic agility. By leveraging CARAF, organisations can thoroughly evaluate their cryptographic systems' agility, identify potential vulnerabilities, and assess the associated risks. This analysis can be used for the development of a mitigation strategy that aligns with the organisation’s risk tolerance. Essentially, CARAF provides a structured approach for organisations to navigate the challenges of crypto agility, enabling them to make informed decisions about their cryptographic infrastructure and security postures in the face of evolving threats and technological advancements. Further details on CARAF and Mosca’s QRA, and their comparison can be found in  .   The methodology used for the Mosca framework often results in assigning a low-risk classification when ‘z’ representing the time to compromise, ranges from 15 to 20 years. This approach tends to prioritise items with extended security and expected useful life timeframes over high-impact areas that may not require a prolonged security useful life. The emphasis is placed on identifying sensitive or critical data that could be vulnerable to future threats, including scenarios such as a ‘store now and decrypt later’ attack. The risk determination process categorises assets as either ‘at risk’ or ‘not at risk’ without considering nuanced risk levels for effective prioritisation. This means that assets with significant impact, such as the telecommunication control plane, may have lower ‘x’ or ‘y’ values but should not be categorised as having low, or no risk, and points to the need for more nuanced risk assessment  .  In 2016, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) projected that a quantum computer capable of breaking 2000-bit RSA encryption could be built by 2030 for about a billion dollars  . However, various research institutes and technology firms have offered different timelines that range from less than 10 to up to 30 years. A reliance on speculative quantum timelines for risk assessment could potentially lead organisations to adopt a passive ‘wait-and-see’ approach. Organisations run the risk of being caught off guard, or left with insufficient time to take mitigation measures, if there is a breakthrough in the advancement of quantum computing in the near future. This risk increases if there is a new discovery, or design flaws, in the current crypto systems running in existing environments.  Our suggested approach moves away from relying on a specific quantum timeline and instead focuses on strengthening the overall cybersecurity risk management framework. Rather than adopting an entirely new framework, quantum risk management should be integrated into existing cybersecurity practices. The process should be continuous and adaptable based on dynamic threats, emerging vulnerabilities, and evolving regulatory environments. With an eye toward the need for the constant vigilance and adaptability that an ever-changing cybersecurity environment requires, key factors for managing quantum risk within an organisation are outlined below:  Addressing the quantum threat requires that organisations proactively assess their readiness and understand both known challenges and potential unknown implications. The first step involves cataloguing all instances of cryptography usage which will include encryption keys, algorithms, applications, and their associated business processes. This comprehensive inventory will empower organisations to achieve crypto agility and enable strategic planning and adaptability in the evolving quantum-safe security landscape.  Effective monitoring of potential impacts requires careful consideration and the maintenance of critical elements. At a minimum, these elements should encompass the following aspects :  Applications: Organisations should assess both in-house and vendor applications, examining their utilisation of cryptographic algorithms. An inventory of critical and high-availability applications, along with an overview of internal and external application connections, is vital for a thorough understanding of the cryptographic landscape.  Third-party vendors: Evaluate vendor roadmaps to ascertain their support for post-quantum cryptography. Procurement considerations should align with the organisation’s commitment to PQC to ensure that vendors comply with evolving security standards.  Data: It is crucial for organisations to determine the duration required for data asset protection. Classifying datasets based on sensitivity and criticality aids in developing a targeted security strategy. Additionally, organisations must assess the risk of a ‘harvest now, decrypt later’ attack scenario, especially for highly sensitive information.  Regulations: Organisations should be prepared to respond to potential queries from regulators regarding compliance with industry standards and guidelines. Addressing questions promptly and transparently is essential to maintaining regulatory compliance.  Location of data: Data residency introduces a layer of complexity, as different jurisdictions may have varying timelines for adopting post-quantum cryptographic measures. Organisations must align their strategies with regional timelines to ensure a cohesive and effective implementation of security measures. By systematically addressing these considerations, organisations can proactively navigate the challenges posed by the evolving quantum threat landscape.  According to the World Economic Forum’s Global Future Council on Quantum Computing, a staggering 20 billion digital devices are projected to require upgrading or replacement with PQC within the next two decades  . Based on the scale of the required transition, it will not be a mere switch-out or patch. PQC will profoundly transform numerous devices and systems including ATMs, TV set-top boxes, smartphones, and many more. Algorithm replacement, a key aspect of transition, is disruptive and often requires years to complete. There is an urgent need for organisations to plan for, and adopt, a posture of crypto agility.  Commencing this transformative journey is not just recommended – it’s a strategic imperative. Organisations are advised to adopt a pragmatic and phased approach, with key plans and objectives serving as a foundational framework for the migration process:  Identify critical business processes: Identify key processes that are heavily reliant on critical data to understand specific areas demanding immediate attention.  Conduct comprehensive risk assessment: Undertake a thorough risk assessment against critical business processes to evaluate vulnerabilities and potential threats for the creation of a risk register for structured mitigation.  Establish risk tolerance and crypto agility: Define risk tolerance levels and embrace crypto agility principles, prioritising remediation efforts based on asset value or risk. Understand quantum technology capabilities and challenges, assessing the business impact of quantum computing advancements for informed decision-making in the quantum era.  A phased approach enables gradual adaptation, a focus on higher-value or higher-risk assets, and strategic alignment with the evolving quantum technology landscape.  Following the identification of cryptography uses for key business processes, and an initial risk assessment, organisations must adopt a vigilant and adaptive strategy that addresses expected quantum-resistant security challenges. Continuous development and monitoring are imperative:  Monitor quantum computing development: Stay informed about ongoing developments, breakthroughs, and potential quantum applications that could impact existing cryptographic systems.  Understand vulnerabilities in crypto systems: Develop a comprehensive understanding of both known and emerging cryptographic vulnerabilities associated with quantum threats through continuous research and awareness initiatives.  Adhere to standards and regulatory requirements: Align with the emerging standards and regulatory requirements set by national cybersecurity institutions, such as the three new PQC standards recently announced by NIST  .  Evaluate vendor readiness: Assess the readiness of third-party vendors and solution providers in the quantum realm, including technologies based on PQC, quantum key distribution (QKD), and quantum random number generators (QRNG).  Enhance crypto agility: Strive to efficiently update cryptographic algorithms, parameters, processes, and technologies to respond adeptly to new protocols, standards, and security threats posed by quantum computing. Consider factors such as data and cryptographic assets, cryptographic keys, and infrastructure limitations.  Furthermore, organisations should consider hybrid solutions that integrate classical and quantum-ready approaches. This strategic approach overlays existing security measures with robust post-quantum cryptography algorithms, providing assurance during the transition to quantum-safe security.  By adopting these ongoing measures, organisations can establish a resilient posture in the face of quantum computing advancements. This continuous development and monitoring strategy will fortify cryptographic systems and enable organisations to navigate the complexities of the evolving quantum landscape with agility and preparedness.  Forward-leaning companies and governments are preparing for a quantum computing future and positioning themselves to capture the many benefits of this technology. Yet, more can and should be done, and collaboration is needed. Governments, researchers, academics, and industries will need to work together on policies to accelerate the adoption of new educational curricula, fund research and development, and create new talent pipelines.  Migrating to quantum-safe security requires a multi-pronged approach that combines proactive action, strategic planning, and continuous adaptation. In what follows, we summarise key next steps and considerations:  Inventory & assessment: Start by identifying all assets and systems that rely on cryptography, especially those using vulnerable algorithms such as RSA and ECC. Prioritise assets based on their importance and the sensitivity of the data that they handle. Evaluate how the adoption of quantum-resistant algorithms might impact their performance and compatibility.  Pilots & testing: Engage in pilot projects to test chosen PQC solutions in real-world scenarios. Assess the impact of PQC solutions on performance, check for compatibility issues, and identify potential integration challenges. Gather valuable data and feedback from these pilot projects to refine and enhance the overall migration strategy for the future.  Planning & strategy: Develop a comprehensive migration strategy for adopting PQC algorithms. Evaluate and select PQC algorithms that align with specific security needs and requirements. Prioritise systems holding high-value data and critical infrastructure. Factor in costs, resources, and training considerations for each phase of the migration.  Deployment & rollout: Implement PQC solutions in a phased manner, starting with high-risk or critical systems and data. Establish robust key management and lifecycle practices specifically designed for PQC keys to ensure their secure and effective use.  Awareness & training: Educate employees on the risks associated with quantum computing and emphasise the necessity for migration to quantum-safe systems. Provide training to equip teams with the knowledge and skills required to securely use and manage quantum-safe systems. Foster a culture of cybersecurity awareness and vigilance across the organisation.  Monitoring & maintenance: Continuously monitor implemented PQC solutions for vulnerabilities and performance. Stay informed about the evolving quantum threat landscape and adapt security measures.

It is the expectation of individuals that digital technologies and services, and the organisations providing them, will protect all stakeholder interests and uphold societal expectations and values  The core of Digital Trust is the notion that we need to safeguard:    There are already well-established and mature cybersecurity solutions for securing systems and infrastructure, including firewalls and software for network intrusion detection and prevention, malware analysis and detection, and vulnerability scanning. In this paper, we will focus on what we believe will be crucial to delivering trustworthy digital technologies and services going forward.  In the realm of Digital Trust, three critical security aspects stand out from traditional cybersecurity paradigms. Each aspect addresses specific challenges inherent to the evolving digital landscape:   In expansive digital domains such as the Metaverse, and within the context of cryptocurrencies in particular, the preservation of digital identity becomes paramount. Protecting individuals and organisations from impersonation and fraud is a multifaceted challenge. Innovative solutions, such as biometric authentication, decentralised identity frameworks, and blockchain technology, are crucial to establishing and safeguarding digital identities. The goal of digital identity management is to create robust systems that can reliably authenticate and verify the digital personas of users to ensure trust and security in virtual spaces.  : As our transactions and data processing activities increasingly migrate to the cloud, ensuring the confidentiality of sensitive data, especially Personally Identifiable Information (PII), is imperative. Encryption, secure data transmission protocols, and robust access controls are integral to safeguarding data privacy. Additionally, compliance with data protection regulations, like GDPR, plays a pivotal role in establishing transparent and ethical data practices and fosters trust among users regarding the secure handling of their information in digital environments.   The rapid advancement of AI introduces a new and unique set of security challenges. Embedding security into AI systems is crucial to preventing malicious or unethical use. Adversarial attacks, biased algorithms, and unintended consequences are potential pitfalls. Implementing secure development practices, robust testing procedures, and ongoing monitoring is essential. Ethical considerations, explainability, and accountability frameworks are also vital in ensuring the responsible deployment of AI technologies. Collaborative efforts across industries and interdisciplinary approaches are necessary to stay ahead of evolving threats in the AI landscape.  To address these aspects of Digital Trust, a holistic and proactive approach is essential. The convergence of technological innovations, regulatory frameworks, and ethical considerations forms the foundation for building resilient, secure, and trustworthy digital ecosystems.   That said, in building a trustworthy digital economy and society, it is crucial to recognise that technology alone is insufficient. As illustrated in Figure 1, consideration must extend to the people and process aspects when operationalising Digital Trust.  Competent resources: Developing Digital Trust requires a workforce equipped with the necessary professional skillsets and qualifications. Competent resources ensure the effective implementation and management of a variety of emerging technologies that are critical for building and maintaining trust.  Continuous staff upskilling and training: The dynamic nature of technology requires a workforce that is adaptable and continuously upskilled. Regular training programmes are essential to keep employees abreast of the latest developments, security threats, and best practices, ensuring that they can effectively contribute to Digital Trust initiatives.  Creating awareness: Organisations must foster awareness of the significance of Digital Trust within their workforces. This includes an understanding of the impact of employee actions on cybersecurity and overall trustworthiness. Employee awareness campaigns contribute to a culture that values and prioritises Digital Trust.  Management systems and governance frameworks: Establishing proper governance frameworks and management systems is crucial for guiding employees in executing digital transformation initiatives. These frameworks will provide a structured approach to decision-making, risk management, and compliance, ensuring that technology adoption is aligned with the goals of Digital Trust.  Regular assessments and audits: To identify and rectify potential risks or gaps associated with cybersecurity and Digital Trust, organisations should conduct regular assessments and audits. These evaluations will help in proactively addressing vulnerabilities, enhancing security measures, and maintaining the integrity of digital systems.  In summary, people and process elements are integral components of a strategy to cultivate Digital Trust. By investing in competent resources, fostering continuous upskilling, creating awareness, and implementing robust governance frameworks and assessment procedures, organisations can fortify their digital ecosystems and create trust among users and stakeholders.  In the remainder of this article, we will investigate a set of questions that should be asked by organisations in their digital transformation journeys. The questions and their associated Digital Trust elements are summarised in the table below.   Interest in zero trust security has been largely driven by government mandates, vendor hype, ransomware attacks, and the needs of a hybrid workforce. According to Gartner, over 60% of organisations will embrace zero trust as a starting point for their cybersecurity strategies by 2025  .  Prevailing IT security architectures depend on ‘implicit trust,’ which is granted once certain criteria are met, such as when a user is inside a corporate network. This is a vulnerability that demands remediation to prevent excessive access, as users have relatively unrestricted access to resources once inside the network under implicit trust protocols. The zero trust model dismantles implicit trust, ushering in a paradigm where trust is continuously assessed, explicitly calculated, and dynamically adaptive, contingent on identity and context. This model serves as a guiding principle for security strategies that not only define the architectural landscape but also enhance security posture and fortify cyber resilience. Organisations embracing the zero trust mindset and architecture stand to gain two pivotal technical outcomes:  : Zero trust principles significantly bolster the resiliency of IT infrastructures. A zero trust network, crafted to operate even in the presence of adversaries, excels at containing and managing incidents. This proactive approach diminishes the likelihood of business-impacting events such as ransomware attacks, data compromises, and malware infections. The consequent reduction in risk that zero trust models provide, contributes to the overall robustness and security of the business.  : Modern work environments must be adaptable to accommodate the anticipated hybrid nature of work in the future. Zero trust principles seamlessly support remote workers’ use of both managed and unmanaged devices, remote data (e.g., IaaS), and remote applications (e.g., SaaS). A secure zero trust implementation enables the realisation of an "anywhere, any time, on any appropriate device" approach that will be crucial for supporting a dynamic and hybrid workforce.  A zero trust approach can play a pivotal role in achieving overall Digital Trust by redefining traditional security paradigms, fortifying defences, and instilling confidence in users engaged in digital interactions. As digital transformation accelerates, the conventional approach of assuming trust is no longer tenable, prompting the need for a more sophisticated and proactive security model that emphasises continuous verification, explicit calculation, and adaptive trust based on identity and context. Here are some examples of how zero trust can enable Digital Trust:  : Digital identity is the cornerstone of secure online interactions. Zero trust challenges the conventional notion of trusting users and devices by default. Instead, it advocates continuous authentication and authorisation, ensuring that trust is earned and maintained throughout the digital journey. Zero trust models leverage multifactor authentication, biometrics, and contextual information to establish and validate identities. This meticulous scrutiny reduces the risk of unauthorised access, identity theft, and impersonation. By embracing zero trust principles in digital identity management, organisations enhance their ability to safeguard user identities across various platforms, including the Metaverse and cryptocurrency ecosystems. The continuous assessment of digital identities fosters confidence among users that their online personas are protected, thereby contributing to the establishment of Digital Trust.  : Zero trust can be extended to data privacy, which is a critical concern in an era marked by cloud-based transactions and ubiquitous data processing. In a zero trust architecture, the default assumption is that no entity, whether internal or external, should be implicitly trusted. This approach is particularly relevant when transacting and processing sensitive data, including personally identifiable information. Implementing zero trust in data privacy involves encryption, secure data transmission protocols, and robust access controls. By assuming a position of continuous scrutiny, organisations employing zero trust frameworks are better equipped to detect and thwart potential data breaches. This not only enhances the confidentiality of sensitive information but also instils confidence among users that their data is being handled with the utmost care and security.  As the influence of AI grows, so does the need to secure AI systems from malicious exploitation. Zero trust principles are instrumental in embedding security into AI processes. The rapid evolution of AI technology introduces potential risks including adversarial attacks and unintended consequences. Zero trust in AI security involves integrating security measures into the development lifecycle of AI systems. This includes secure development practices, robust testing, and ongoing monitoring. Moreover, ethical considerations such as transparency, fairness, and accountability are integral to the responsible deployment of AI. By adopting a zero trust approach to AI security, organisations can mitigate the risks associated with the malicious use of AI, thereby reinforcing Digital Trust.  The implementation of zero trust technologies marks a fundamental shift from traditional network security practices, and while the benefits are manifold in enhancing organisational security posture, the transition to zero trust is far from straightforward. It requires a meticulous rethinking of network design and access strategies, with several challenges that demand attention.  The implementation of a zero trust architecture often brings about considerable operational overhead expenses. This is the case because zero trust mandates the continuous verification of all users and devices trying to access the network, regardless of whether they are inside or outside the organisation’s perimeters. For example, an organisation may need to frequently update and monitor access policies to ensure that they accurately reflect the current threat landscape and access needs, a process that can be both time-consuming and labour-intensive.  Furthermore, extending zero trust principles to legacy systems presents a unique set of complications. Older systems were not designed with zero trust in mind, and many lack the necessary interfaces to support modern authentication and authorisation protocols. A typical example can be found in manufacturing firms, where legacy industrial control systems, essential for day-to-day operations, may not support the latest security protocols. Retrofitting these systems to align with zero trust principles can be a resource-intensive task that requires both innovative technical solutions and substantial investment.  Another critical challenge is the scarcity of resources with the requisite skillsets. Zero trust is a relatively new and evolving concept, and there is a limited pool of professionals that has extensive experience in implementing such frameworks. For example, an organisation may struggle to find IT professionals who are adept at configuring the sophisticated access control policies required by a zero trust architecture, or who have the expertise required to manage the sophisticated network segmentation strategies it entails.  In summary, while the zero trust model offers a robust framework for securing modern digital assets, the path to its successful implementation is laden with operational, technical, and human resource hurdles. Addressing these challenges requires a well-structured approach, investment in the right technology, and most importantly, the cultivation of a skilled workforce capable of navigating the complexities of zero trust implementation. It is a complex journey, but one that can lead to a significantly more secure IT environment for organisations willing to make the commitment.  AI security is a key enabler of Digital Trust as AI-supported applications and services are becoming pervasive. AI governance, in turn, sets the foundation, including the overall culture and structure for managing AI risk within an organisation to ensure ethical, lawful, and reliable use of AI in a manner that earns public trust.  Generative AI (GenAI) can be used to create a wide variety of content including text, code, images, and videos. This content can be used with good or malicious intent, so it is important to have safeguards in place to prevent GenAI from being used for malicious purposes.  To address the ethical and societal concerns surrounding AI (including GenAI), it is essential to develop and operationalise effective organisational governance frameworks. These frameworks should be designed to ensure that AI is used in a responsible and ethical manner.  Some of the overarching principles of effective AI governance include:  Once we have defined our overarching AI principles, we need to develop a governance framework that sets out how these principles will be put into practice. This framework should include policies and procedures for the development, deployment, monitoring, and evaluation of AI systems.  With the rise of GenAI tools such as ChatGPT, some recommended practices that organisations should adopt to ensure a responsible approach to AI include (using ChatGPT as an example):   Decide which use cases for ChatGPT are acceptable and which ones are not. For example, organisations might want to allow ChatGPT to be used to generate personalised learning materials for students, but not to create fake news articles or deepfakes.  ChatGPT was trained on a massive dataset of text and code which could have contained personal information, confidential data, or biased content. It is important to avoid using ChatGPT to process any type of data that is sensitive or that could be used to harm or discriminate against individuals or groups.   ChatGPT is a powerful language model, but it is not perfect. It is important to verify the accuracy of any output from ChatGPT before using it. This is especially important for high-stakes applications such as ChatGPT use for medical diagnosis or legal decision-making.   When using ChatGPT, it is important to be aware of the relevant laws and regulations. For example, organisations need to ensure that they are not violating any privacy laws when collecting or processing data and that they are not infringing on any copyrights when generating content.  In addition to these recommendations, it is also important to be transparent about how ChatGPT is used. Users need to know what data is being collected, how it is being used, and what they can expect from the output of the model. It is also important to have a process in place for users to report any problems or concerns they have about the use of ChatGPT. By taking these steps, organisations will go a long way in ensuring that ChatGPT is used in a responsible and ethical way.  For further details, the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF) serves as a comprehensive resource for organisations of all sizes, to manage AI risks effectively and to promote both trust and the responsible use of AI technology  . Figure 2 summarises the core functions of the NIST AI RMF:  In today's digital landscape, where Digital Trust is at stake and cyber threats are increasingly sophisticated, organisations must prioritise robust security measures to protect their assets, data, and reputations. Security monitoring solutions play a crucial role through the continuous surveillance and analysis of an organisation's security posture to detect, respond to, and mitigate potential threats in real time. A Security Operations Centre (SOC) serves as the ‘command centre’ for these activities, ensuring that organisations can effectively manage and mitigate cyber risks.  However, the operational challenges that come with running an efficient SOC can be daunting. As an example, the effort required to process and review large volumes of security alerts can lead to ‘alert fatigue’ among SOC analysts that can potentially result in cybersecurity attacks that aren’t detected. The integration of GenAI and NLP holds the potential to be 'game changing' for SOC efficiency.   It is important to understand the current role of NLP in SOC operations, and the differences between NLP and GenAI, before explaining how the combination of the two can improve both SOC efficiency and the security posture of an organisation.  Natural Language Processing (NLP) plays a significant role in enhancing cybersecurity monitoring and threat detection by enabling machines to understand, interpret, and respond to human language. Here are five examples of how NLP can be useful:  : NLP can be used to analyse logs and security events to extract meaningful information from unstructured log data. By understanding natural language patterns in logs, NLP algorithms can identify anomalies or potential security incidents that may go unnoticed through traditional detection methods.  : NLP can be applied to process and analyse threat intelligence feeds, security blogs, news articles, and social media to identify emerging threats and vulnerabilities. Security teams can stay informed about the latest cyber threats by using NLP to extract relevant information and perform sentiment analysis.   NLP can enhance email security by analysing the content of emails and identifying phishing attempts. It can detect suspicious language, unusual patterns, or social engineering techniques, helping to filter out malicious emails and protect users from phishing attacks.  : NLP-powered chatbots can provide immediate assistance during security incidents. Users can interact with a chatbot in natural language to report incidents, ask security-related questions, or receive guidance on security best practices. Use of NLP chatbots will enhance incident response capabilities and help improve communication between security teams and end-users.   NLP can be used to analyse user behaviour patterns in communication channels such as email, chat logs, and collaboration platforms. With their ability to understand natural language context, NLP algorithms can detect anomalies in user behaviour that may indicate insider threats, unauthorised access, or compromised accounts.  These examples illustrate how leveraging NLP for cybersecurity monitoring and threat detection enables a more sophisticated and context-aware approach to identifying and responding to security incidents. NLP enhances the capabilities of security systems by processing and understanding human language, thereby improving the overall effectiveness of cybersecurity measures.  While NLP offers valuable capabilities for cybersecurity monitoring, it also comes with certain limitations:  Evading linguistic analysis: Sophisticated attackers can intentionally craft messages to evade linguistic analysis. They may use obfuscation techniques, encryption, or slang to communicate without triggering NLP-based threat detection. This makes it difficult for NLP systems to consistently identify and interpret malicious communications.  Limited support for unstructured data: NLP is more effective for analysing structured data than unstructured data. While it can analyse textual content, much of the relevant cybersecurity information exists in unstructured forms such as log files, network traffic, and system events. Extracting actionable insights from these unstructured sources poses challenges for NLP.  Dependency on quality and quantity of training data: The effectiveness of NLP models depends heavily on the quality and quantity of training data. If the training data is not representative of the diverse language used in cybersecurity contexts, the model may struggle to accurately identify threats. Additionally, biases present in the training data may be perpetuated in the model's outputs.  Handling new and evolving threats: NLP models may struggle to adapt quickly to new and evolving cyber threats. Traditional rule-based systems may be more adept at handling novel attack methods, as NLP models often require retraining with new data to effectively detect emerging threats. The lag in adaptation can pose a significant limitation in fast-paced and dynamic cybersecurity environments.  While NLP provides valuable insights, it should be complemented with other technologies and methodologies to create a comprehensive and resilient cybersecurity strategy.  Neither Generative AI (GenAI) nor NLP is inherently superior or inferior to the other, but rather, they serve different purposes and can complement each other across applications. Both are valuable technologies, and their strengths lie in different domains.  GenAI excels at creating new content, whether that be text, images, or other forms of data. It can generate realistic and contextually relevant content based on patterns it has learned during training. It is often used for content creation, creative tasks, text generation, and the simulation of diverse data scenarios. In contrast, NLP focuses on understanding and processing natural language. It deals with tasks such as language understanding, sentiment analysis, text classification, and named entity recognition. It is widely used for applications such as chatbots, language translation, sentiment analysis, and information extraction from textual data.  GenAI, therefore, can be used to complement NLP in multiple aspects. For example:  Content augmentation: GenAI can be used to generate diverse and synthetic data, which can be used to augment training datasets for NLP models. This will help improve the robustness and generalisation of NLP systems.  Simulating real-world scenarios: Generative models can simulate realistic scenarios, including cyber threats, which can be valuable for training and testing NLP-based threat detection systems. This can be especially useful when real-world threat data may be limited due to privacy concerns.  Enhancing training data quality: By generating additional data instances, GenAI can be used to overcome limitations in training data quality by generating additional data instances that provide added context and diversity to NLP models.  Addressing data privacy concerns: Generative models can generate synthetic content without relying on real incident data which helps address the privacy concerns associated with using actual threat data for training NLP models.  Improving response to new threats: GenAI can be employed to simulate new and evolving cyber threats, allowing security teams to proactively prepare for, and detect, emerging threats. This complements the reactive nature of NLP-based threat detection.  Combining GenAI and NLP can significantly enhance the capabilities of an SOC by providing a more comprehensive and adaptive approach to cybersecurity. This can be summarised as follows:  : GenAI can create synthetic threat scenarios to simulate diverse and evolving attack vectors. NLP processes and understands threat intelligence feeds and extracts relevant information about known vulnerabilities, tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). By integrating the synthetic scenarios from GenAI with the understanding of real-world threats NLP brings, SOC teams gain a more enriched and dynamic threat intelligence dataset. This will aid in proactive threat detection and incident response.  : GenAI can simulate incident response scenarios and create synthetic incidents for training purposes. NLP can be used to understand and process incident reports and to automate the extraction of relevant information. The SOC can leverage GenAI for realistic incident simulations and use NLP to automatically extract insights from incident reports to streamline incident response planning and execution.  : NLP analyses logs, alerts, and security event descriptions to understand the context of security incidents. GenAI can generate additional context for security events by simulating potential attack scenarios. The SOC gains a deeper understanding of security events from both NLP linguistic analysis and GenAI contextual enrichment. This will improve the accuracy of threat detection and reduce the number of false positives. These capabilities can also enhance the speed and efficiency of incident and management reporting for the SOC team.   GenAI continuously adapts the scenarios it generates based on evolving threats. NLP processes real-time security information, identifying new threats and vulnerabilities. The SOC benefits from a dynamic and adaptive threat detection system that uses GenAI for scenario simulation and NLP for real-time analysis to improve its readiness for emerging threats.   GenAI can create synthetic phishing scenarios for user awareness training. NLP can be used to process user feedback and identify common issues related to security awareness. By combining GenAI training scenarios with NLP-driven user feedback analysis, SOC teams can develop user awareness programmes that are more targeted and effective for addressing security vulnerabilities.  By combining the creative content generation capabilities of GenAI with the language understanding features of NLP, a SOC team can create more adaptive, informed, and proactive defence strategies against evolving cyber threats. This collaborative approach can help improve incident response, threat detection, and user awareness and ultimately strengthen the overall cybersecurity posture of the organisation.  Quantum computing is a double-edged sword. While it has the potential to solve certain types of complex calculations, including optimisation problems and simulations of quantum systems, more efficiently than classical computational tools, it can also be exploited to break widely used encryption algorithms. Algorithms such as RSA and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), which form the basis of secure communication on the internet, rely on the difficulty of certain mathematical problems. Quantum algorithms, such as Shor's algorithm, have demonstrated the potential to efficiently solve these problems and pose a threat to the security of encrypted data. These current (and expected future) advances in quantum computing threaten to negate the protection required to maintain Digital Trust. In particular, quantum computing poses significant threats to the three pillars of cybersecurity:  Breaking cryptographic hash functions: Quantum computers can efficiently crack certain cryptographic hash functions, such as SHA-256, which are used for digital signatures and for verifying the identity of entities (e.g., websites, users). The use of quantum computers could compromise trust and security by allowing malicious actors to forge signatures and impersonate legitimate entities.  Man-in-the-middle attacks: With the ability to break encryption faster, quantum computers could make it easier to intercept and tamper with communication channels and allow attackers to steal authentication credentials or redirect traffic to fake websites.  Breaking digital signatures: Digital signatures rely on public-key cryptography and are used to verify that data has not been tampered with. Quantum computers could be used to break these algorithms, allowing attackers to modify data and make it appear unaltered, potentially leading to financial losses, the spread of misinformation, or even physical harm.  Manipulating timestamps: Quantum algorithms could be used to forge timestamps on digital documents, making it difficult to track data provenance and verify the authenticity of records. This could have implications for legal proceedings, financial transactions, and historical records.  Breaking encryption algorithms: Popular encryption algorithms, such as RSA and ECC, are vulnerable to quantum attacks. Attacks on encryption algorithms could lead to the decryption of sensitive data stored on computers or transmitted over the internet, including financial records, medical information, and personal data.  While quantum computers that pose a credible threat are still years away, the threat of “Harvest now and decrypt later” is a real, immediate, security risk that needs to be addressed today  . This is a ‘long game’ attack where bad actors collect encrypted data, by way of breaches, or undertake passive interception and hoard the encrypted data, waiting for the day when quantum computers can decrypt that information. Therefore, it is imperative to start using quantum-resistant algorithms as soon as possible. Today, a bad actor can record, and store (harvest) encrypted data that is streaming through the internet or cloud, from a specific website, server, email client, or whichever target they deem worthy of attack. With enough resources, that bad actor could capture petabytes of data (or more) from general internet traffic.   The question of when cryptography will be broken by quantum computing is unfortunate, as it implicitly frames the threat to be some time in the future. The threat exists today, but the impact will become apparent in the future. Data that is considered securely protected today is already lost to a future quantum adversary if it has been stolen or harvested. All data—past, present, and future—that is not protected using quantum-safe security is at risk, and the longer we postpone the migration to quantum-safe standards, the more data there will be that is at risk.  Our experience makes it clear that there will not be a one-size-fits-all strategy when it comes to migrating to quantum-safe security. Given the long-term nature of the threat, and the dynamic environment surrounding quantum computing, it is also clear that a cryptographic strategy needs to consider multiple time frames and needs to consider potential step improvements in quantum technology development. To supplement the standards development underway by private industry players, governments need to accelerate their investment in quantum-safe cryptosystems and proactively promote the widespread adoption of the same.  The threat of cryptographically relevant quantum computers (CRQC) is significant, but the timeline for the materialisation of the threats they will enable is unknown. How can an organisation quantify the risk of cryptographically relevant quantum computers when they don’t yet exist? The immediate best practice suggests creating several scenarios of the risk a quantum threat poses to a specific asset, with some of these scenarios deemed as “more likely” than others.  The argument for starting to address the threat that quantum computers will pose to existing security systems now, is based on the following considerations:   Cryptographic technologies are integrated into most of the digital products commonly used by organisations to run their daily operations.  Some of the applications and systems currently used for energy, transportation, finance, and government infrastructure have expected product useful lives of 15 to 30 years, with longer requirements for data protection and privacy.  The time required to migrate installed cryptographic technologies (e.g., SHA1) to something newer is measured in years.  The number of cryptographic systems that organisations will need to migrate to use new “quantum-safe” cryptography will be large.  Most organisations have no clear view of the cryptographic technologies used in IT operations and this will make it difficult to discover, and then prioritise, the systems to be upgraded to post-quantum cryptography.  Migrating to quantum-safe security requires a multi-pronged approach that combines proactive action, strategic planning, and continuous adaptation. Table 1 summarises some key considerations.  
 
Migration to quantum-safe security is a continuous process and will take multiple years. It is important to stay adaptable, embrace new technologies, and adjust strategy as the landscape evolves. By taking proactive steps, and actively engaging with the community, we can ensure that our organisations are prepared for the challenges and opportunities of the quantum era.  While 5G technology promises transformative benefits like high-speed and low-latency communications, its global adoption has encountered challenges, leading to a slower rollout than initially anticipated. Key factors affecting the pace of rollout include the substantial infrastructure investments required for deployment, regulatory and spectrum allocation delays, and technological hurdles related to ensuring widespread coverage. Economic uncertainties, influenced by global events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have also impacted investment priorities and consumer readiness, with the initial high cost and limited availability of 5G-enabled devices posing additional barriers. Furthermore, public health concerns, despite lacking scientific backing, have fuelled resistance in some areas. Nevertheless, as these challenges are progressively addressed—through regulatory adjustments, technological advancements, and increasing consumer device availability—5G adoption is expected to accelerate, unlocking its full potential for a wide range of applications and services.  The rollout of 5G technology brings transformative potential for connectivity, speed, and efficiency but also introduces several key security challenges. These challenges stem from the technology’s complexity, its extensive use of software, and the broad range of applications and services it aims to support. Key 5G security challenges include:  : 5G networks utilise a more extensive and complex infrastructure in comparison to their predecessors, including the vast number of connected devices and new technologies such as network slicing and edge computing. This complexity significantly increases the attack surface, offering more opportunities for cyberattacks and making security management more challenging.  : 5G networks rely on a global supply chain that includes many vendors providing hardware, software, and services. Ensuring the security of this supply chain is crucial, as vulnerabilities or malicious insertions at any point can compromise the entire network. The risk is exacerbated by the potential for state-sponsored threats aimed at exploiting supply chain weaknesses for espionage or sabotage purposes.   The massive amount of data transmitted over 5G networks, combined with advanced technologies capable of processing this data at unprecedented speeds, raises significant privacy concerns. Protecting user data against unauthorised access, and ensuring compliance with data protection regulations, becomes increasingly complex in a 5G context.  : While 5G promises enhanced security features, including improved encryption compared with earlier generations, implementing end-to-end encryption across the entire network and ensuring the confidentiality of data in transit remains a challenge. This is particularly the case for scenarios involving network slicing, where different slices may have varying security requirements and capabilities.   5G networks enable dynamic network configuration and management to support a wide range of applications with differing performance requirements. This dynamic nature, while being a strength of 5G, complicates the security management of the network. Ensuring consistent security policies and effective incident response across an ever-changing network topology require sophisticated security tools and strategies.  Addressing these challenges is critical for ensuring the security and reliability of 5G networks. It requires a concerted effort from network operators, equipment manufacturers, service providers, and regulatory bodies to develop and implement robust security frameworks that can adapt to the evolving threat landscape associated with 5G technology.  With the ongoing rollout by Mobile Network Operators (MNOs), the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) published the ‘Guidelines for CII (Critical information Infrastructure) Owners to Enhance Cyber Security for 5G Use Cases’ in April 2022. The guidelines outline possible cyber threats to systems connected to 5G services and provides recommendations to mitigate these risks. Here are five key security recommendations from the CSA guidelines:  : CIIOs must ensure that user equipment connecting to 5G networks achieves high levels of security assurance. This includes maintaining valid security assurance certifications, such as those under CSA’s Cybersecurity Labelling Scheme (CLS) and keeping software/firmware updated to mitigate known vulnerabilities. Additionally, equipment nearing the end of its service life should be replaced to prevent network compromises.  : Protecting data from unauthorised access and corruption is paramount. CIIOs should implement encryption for data in transit across 5G networks. In scenarios where encryption may not be feasible, data integrity verification measures should be applied. Ideally, end-to-end encryption is recommended for all system communications. For data stored on user equipment (UE), secure industry-standard encryption algorithms should be used, with hardware-based root of trust modules (e.g., TPM) deployed to protect critical data.   The configuration of systems connected to 5G networks should be meticulously planned, documented, reviewed, and tested. Implementing technical solutions to document and maintain configurations can facilitate system recovery and prevent misconfigurations. CIIOs should ensure that UE, regardless of location or direct connection to the CII network, complies with the latest cybersecurity policies.  Access to the CII network should be strictly controlled based on the user’s credentials and the security posture of the UE. This encompasses implementing network access control, identity and access management, and interface authentication. Access control policies should be regularly reviewed, and multi-factor authentication is recommended for accessing UE or connecting to the CII network through 5G.  : Continuous monitoring of devices is essential for detecting abnormalities and security incidents. CIIOs should monitor both the operational status and physical location of UE to prevent unauthorised relocation. For devices that may not always be connected to the 5G network, such as IoT sensors, system operators should be alerted if the devices fail to connect after a predefined interval or in the event of unauthorised access.  However, 5G is a relatively new technology, and the technical solutions available to system owners—Critical Information Infrastructure Owners (CIIOs) and enterprises—to mitigate the associated cybersecurity risks of deployment, may not be sufficiently tested for effectiveness and performance. Specific details for some of the solutions, such as the encryption schemes to use, have either not been prescribed or are said to be dependent on the 5G use case.  To address the need for testing that details the impact of various cybersecurity solutions on the effectiveness and performance of user equipment within 5G networks, a study on 5G cybersecurity technical solutions was commissioned by CSA. The intent of the study was to provide CSA with information, across a variety of use cases, about how security solutions and measures should be implemented to adequately protect CIIOs’ systems without compromising the potential operational benefits of 5G. The findings of the 5G security study are shared in a follow-up article.  NCS, a prominent digital and technology service provider in the APAC region, offers a comprehensive suite of end-to-end services and digital solutions that encompass applications, infrastructure, engineering, and cybersecurity.

A world without cash – Is it possible? | NCS SG a world without cash – is it possible Contact Us Thank you for your interest. The case for a cashless society The need for real-time security Overcoming challenges hear what our thought leaders have to say about tech: explore the rest of the Future Trends 
                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  The American economist Francis A. Walker famously said that “money is as money does.” His words are perhaps more pertinent now than ever before as societies around the world increasingly embrace digital payments, accelerating the demise of physical forms of money. In the business payments space, cash payments were already projected to be low in 2017, accounting for only 5 percent of all payments and have likely decreased further since. In the consumer space, cash payments made up around 60 percent of all payments but in recent years reliance on cash has been significantly eroded by the introduction of new digital payment platforms and dramatic growth in e-commerce and the adoption of mobile payment apps. According to Visa’s  , less than half of consumers in Southeast Asia (45 percent) deem cash as their most preferred payment method. Preference for cash is lowest in Singapore (15 percent) and cashless payments continue to gain traction, with 10 percent of consumers claiming not to use cash at all. While the basic functions of money will remain unchanged, we will have to get used to a world in which it is intangible and invisible; a world in which financial transactions involve the transfer of digital information — through the ether, as it were — rather than the exchange of coins or banknotes.  A cashless society is no longer merely a hypothetical proposition. It is fast becoming a reality. According to the  by Worldpay from FIS, cash represented just 20.5 percent of global point-of-sale transactions in 2020, a dramatic 32 percent reduction from 2019. Asian economies like China, India, and Indonesia are leading the way in the adoption of cashless transactions. In China, payments via apps like Alipay and WeChat Pay are widely accepted and the country’s mobile payment penetration rate reached , according to Statista. There are reasons to welcome this trend. The World Economic Forum (WEF) asserts that going cashless can  by eliminating the middlemen in transactions, closing the financial inclusion gap, and making it easier to tackle corruption. The Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated the adoption of cash-free payment methods across the globe. Companies and government organisations are waking up to the need for greater levels of digitisation in light of this trend, but many face an uphill struggle.   It’s not hard to see why digital payments are gaining popularity — they are more convenient than cash-based ones and can be processed faster. They also eliminate the need for physical interaction between strangers at a time when such interactions are potentially dangerous, as in the case of the recent pandemic. Beyond these clear advantages there are reasons to believe that moving towards a cashless society could bring about lower rates of financial crime. Non-physical money is inherently harder to steal than cash. Moreover, the greater audit trail of digital transactions could in theory help authorities more effectively tackle corruption and crimes like money laundering and tax evasion. The rise of cashless payments alone will not be enough to stop financial crimes. Rather, it will force criminals to develop more sophisticated digital methods of committing these types of crime. This is why governments and Financial Institutions (FIs) should leverage advances in technology to prevent, identify, and respond to illegal financial activities. According to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), digital tools based on machine learning (ML) and other forms of artificial intelligence (AI) have the potential to help organisations better identify risks and monitor and deal with suspicious activity. Hence, Raphael Too, Client Delivery Lead for Financial Services at NCS, asserts that “a lot of what makes cashless society work is centred around how we can establish better regional linkages in terms of payments, and providing that technology layer to monitor and prevent financial crimes.”   “One aspect of AML and fraud detection we tend to forget is that everything happens on a very siloed basis,” says Chang Chew Lik, Co-Lead of Financial, Industrial and Commercial Client Service Unit at NCS. Until now, individual banks have been conducting their own AML-monitoring and fraud detection activities and there has been little or no exchange of information between financial institutions, which means that it is hard to get a complete picture of what is going on. Chew Lik argues that standardisation and sharing of data across the financial services industry is needed in order to bring down instances of financial crime. There is also a growing need for real-time AML and fraud detection as platforms like PayNow allow consumers to make payments in a matter of seconds. As we look to transition to a more cashless society, more effective and economical real-time detection will be needed across the payment platforms to provide security to consumers and providers.   Cash is on the way out. However, there are many hurdles to overcome before we can transition to a truly cashless society and start reaping its benefits. Participating organisations will need to take proactive actions in areas such as identity management, security, and privacy protection. Countries seeking to accelerate the transition to a cashless society would do well to follow China’s example. The phenomenal growth of platforms like Alipay and WeChat Pay can be ascribed to four key factors: That being said, societies will only go fully cashless when all citizens are willing to embrace a world without cash. This means overcoming concerns around the security of digital transactions and fraud detection. Given the fact that these transactions can be intercepted by cybercriminals who may steal not just money or property but personal information as well, many people are not yet ready to part ways with cash. Some people are also wary of a payment system which requires that every transaction goes through a financial gatekeeper. With regards to the Asian market, Chew Lik says that “…maybe it will be challenging for us to go into a cashless society, at least in my generation.” It's important that the transition to a cashless society is gradual if we want to ensure that such a society is as inclusive as possible. As Raphael notes, “…we don’t want to advance so fast to the point where people who are using cash are seen as backwards, which could cause greater digital exclusion.” NCS SG, Co-Lead of Financial, Industrial and Commercial Client Service Unit NCS SG, Client Delivery Lead, Financial Services Share this article on: Thank you for your enquiry!

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  Singapore’s drive to be a Smart Nation has created opportunities for new entrants to participate in the banking ecosystem. NCS payment platform aims to transform the digital payment landscape in the Asia-Pacific region. Managing payment locally and across various geographies becomes simple and economical with our payment platform. Instead of building an in-house application to process high-volume digital transactions, financial institutions and non-bank financial institutions can tap on our cost-effective and scalable payment platform, making it easier for them to participate in the banking ecosystem faster. As we continue to deliver our core services, our NEXT Services will focus on providing Digital, Cloud, Platform and Cyber solutions that will meet the needs of the financial services sector. We understand the complexity and time needed to build an in-house payment system, as well as the high cost of manually integrating with funds-transfer services. Moreover, there is a lack of inter-bank visibility when it comes to transactions, and at every turn, we must ensure that it meets compliance standards. That is why NCS payment platform makes instant payment and overseas transfers easy, customisable, and ready-to-use. NCS payment hub is a payment platform designed to deliver customer-friendly and operationally superior experiences. It enables Fast and Secure Transfers (FAST) and PayNow transactions, GIRO, and high-value transfers via SWIFT MT and MX messaging formats. With API connectors, our solution is designed for easy integration with banks and overseas funds transfer services. This ability to achieve operational excellence and scale quickly generates long-term cost benefits and is ideal for organisations with regional ambitions. It is a smarter way to work with intelligent routing, API connections, and a central view to track transactions. Pay and receive money faster through a fully automated electronic payment process, from initiation to settlement. With Straight Through Processing (STP), resources can be freed up, delays reduced, and human errors eliminated. NCS payment platform can process FAST payments across multiple channels, including online banking, mobile banking, and new channels that are springing up with the advent of 5G networks. NCS payment platform can optimise the success rate of transactions with automatic sorting and correction of payment transactions. With an integrated routing rule database, our payment engine supports transactions with multiple banks and identifies receiver accounts. The lack of inter-bank visibility has long been a challenge. In response, we have developed a product with a central payment engine. This gives banking officers a bird’s-eye view of the payment process and reduces the time it takes to identify a failed transaction. To help businesses comply effortlessly with industry regulations, NCS payment platform is designed with anti-money laundering security features. It enforces the segregation of duties, ring-fences users’ access to data, and provides audit trails and two-step dual control for static data maintenance. Reports can be automatically generated to save time so that staff can focus on providing high-value outcomes for customers. NCS payment platform can be quickly set up and implemented in a matter of months. Its configurable modules reduce the cost of research and development. It is highly scalable, as API connectors can provide seamless integration and an effective solution for accelerating growth and market expansion for payment businesses.   Share this article on: Discover how you can chart your career and elevate your skills.

                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  As part of Prudential’s customer-centric approach, the life insurer has launched an industry-first chatbot that can provide its Financial Consultants with real-time information specific to their customers’ life insurance plans. Named askPRU, the cognitive-powered chatbot is built on IBM Watson technology and integrated into Prudential’s backend systems. It is able to retrieve instantly data such as a customer’s policy cash value, policy premium due date and status of submitted claims, among others. As askPRU operates round the clock, Prudential’s Financial Consultants can communicate with the chatbot via a mobile application at any time of the day to obtain information pertaining to their customers’ insurance plans, enabling them to be more productive and more responsive. Using IBM Watson’s Conversation Service, askPRU has been trained by NCS’ data scientists¹ to understand non-scripted questions, probe users to get to the intent of their queries and deliver responses in a way that simulates human conversations. Since the pilot launch of askPRU in July 2017, more than half of Prudential’s 4,000 Financial Consultants have started to use the chatbot. Ms. Theresa Nai, Chief Operating Officer at Prudential Singapore, said, askPRU is part of Prudential’s commitment to continuously improve the service experience for its customers. “In today’s fast-paced, time-starved environment, our customers do not have the patience to wait for information. With askPRU, our Financial Consultants can now get faster access to customer-specific information and respond to their customers’ queries even more promptly. askPRU is one of the ways in which we digitally enable our Financial Consultants so they are equipped to meet increasing consumer demands and expectations,” said Ms Nai. askPRU complements PRUONE Express, an enhanced digital point-of-sales portal, to help Prudential’s Financial Consultants engage their customers more efficiently. For instance, PRUONE Express is able to generate a detailed quotation in just three seconds and uses the latest technologies, such as SmartData Capture and Fingerprint Authentication, to facilitate a quicker and more effective consultation and sales process. Launched in August 2017, all of Prudential’s Financial Consultants currently have access to PRUONE Express to complete their sales process and to submit new policy requests. Apart from improving customer experience, askPRU also creates operational efficiencies for the life insurer. Prudential estimates that approximately 30 per cent of its Financial Consultants’ queries received by its Contact Centre consultants today can be answered by askPRU. With frequently-asked queries channelled to the chatbot, Prudential’s Contact Centre consultants will be able to focus on handling more complex enquiries and provide a better service to its Financial Consultants and customers. Designed as a standalone mobile application, askPRU was developed in collaboration with NCS Pte Ltd (NCS), IBM Watson and Nokomai Studios. IBM Watson is a cognitive computing technology platform that uses natural language processing and machine learning to reveal insights from large amounts of structured and unstructured data, such as text and images.   Source:  Share this article on: Discover how you can chart your career and elevate your skills.

The Power of Design Thinking | NCS SG the power of design thinking Contact Us Thank you for your interest. The importance of empathy Design thinking from the ground up explore more 
                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  When design agency IDEO was tasked by bicycle components manufacturer Shimano to find out why 90 percent of Americans don’t ride bikes, the team set out to talk to consumers from all walks of life. They discovered that most people were intimidated by cycling—everything from the retail experience to the cost and complexity of bikes and accessories to the danger of cycling on roads was daunting. Based on this, Shimano designed a simpler bicycle targeted at people who cycle for leisure, changed its retail strategy in stores, and launched a campaign to identify safe cycling routes, IDEO CEO Tim Brown told the Harvard Business Review 1. This problem-solving strategy, known as design thinking, places the end-user at the front and centre of the innovation and product development process. First popularised in product design circles, design thinking is now widely used in many other sectors, including government, healthcare, finance and IT. As with physical consumer products, design thinking in IT is about adopting a human-centric focus when designing solutions. It is an approach that begins with a discovery phase of the customers to understand their needs, and where problems are identified. Solutions are then shaped and prototyped to test for user desirability, business viability and technical feasibility, and then realised through agile development. At the heart of design thinking is empathy. Design-driven organisations, whether they are in technology, advertising or the public service, make it their mission to walk a mile in the shoes of their stakeholders, so as to discover and address their needs and the challenges they face. At NCS, leaders from all units undergo design thinking training, during which they put themselves in the shoes of both their customers and employees to innovate, design and prototype solutions. For example, an NCS project team developing an IT system for a customer service centre paid the centre a visit, posing as a customer. This experience helped them to better understand how the client and its customers interact with the IT system, and to experience firsthand how the system’s performance affects the user experience. In another instance, the corporate team put themselves in the position of the management team, and gained a much better understanding of the types of reports they needed. While nearly all companies will assure their customers that they are the main focus, reality is often quite different — business decisions made at the upper echelons of management sometimes give short shrift to the needs and concerns of end-users. Companies that are serious about design thinking, however, go above and beyond finding out what customers want to finding out why they want it, write McKinsey experts Jennifer Kilian, Hugo Sarrazin and Hyo Yeon2. This is why tech companies like Google, Intel and Microsoft are hiring anthropologists and ethnographers, and why many have armies of designers on their payroll. While ease of use, simplicity and intuitiveness are now de rigueur when it comes to user interface and user experience, these are not the only parts of the tech stack that would benefit from good design. Design thinking should start at the very bottom of the stack, encompassing all layers from foundational architecture to hardware, networking, software and data management. Just as a chain is only as strong as its weakest link, a poorly designed underlying layer could throw off even the most elegantly designed user interface. In the past, designers were often only called upon near the end of the development process, and tasked with making the end product look more aesthetically pleasing and attractive to consumers. Today, however, many organisations recognise that design thinking should play a substantive role from the very beginning of the development process. The need for a coherent, holistic design necessitates a multidisciplinary and collaborative working environment — programmers, data scientists, developers, engineers, designers and marketing personnel can no longer afford to stay in their own departmental bubbles during the product development process. Restructuring organisational processes around design thinking is hard work, and may require some persuasion to change mindsets. Ultimately, however, the payoffs are well worth the trouble: more satisfied customers, new opportunities to grow the business, enhanced collaboration and a strong culture of innovation. When combined with our other core capabilities, design thinking will let us differentiate our products and solutions at every stage of our operations. It enables us to collaborate more closely with our customers as we contribute our expertise and implement new ideas to solve their problems.

                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  Are you still indecisive over your digital transformation priorities? Many organisations are held back in their efforts by the inability to decide on goals, difficulty in justifying budgets, bewilderment over new technologies, lack of digital capabilities, and the list goes on. At NCS Digital, we work with clients across many industries to address these issues. Where in your organisation should you start? Here are five signs to look out for. Any of these would be good areas to kickstart your digital initiatives. Take a look at your Net Promoter Score or any other measure of customer satisfaction. In this digital age, your customers will be all too ready to share the experience that they have had with your brand. They will share it with their friends and their networks, and they will do so publicly. Digitally-savvy customers expect their experience with you to be on par with the best-of-breed Internet companies that they have interacted with. If your customer touchpoints are getting negative feedback, you should be taking a look at how customer experience powered by digital technology can help you to address customers’ frustrations, boost customer scores, increase retention and make a positive impact on your top line. Reimagine how you can transform your customers’ experience with your products and services. Employees are the ones who deliver that “moment of truth” to customers every day. If your employees are encountering obstacles in their work to the point that they lack motivation to do their job well, customer experience will invariably be impacted. A common bugbear that affects employee morale is the time they have to spend dealing with manual, paper-based or convoluted processes. This takes them away from time that could be better spent with the customer. So start by looking at how the introduction of the right digital technologies can help to improve your employees’ experience at work - what needs to be in place to create a digital workplace that will support your employees in the digital economy. An upstart has entered your turf and is making waves. It seems to be able to move much faster than you can - whether onboarding a new customer or bringing a new product to market. One reason for this could be that, as a new company, it had the opportunity to design its business and processes from ground up and apply a new set of technologies to help it work faster and more efficiently and to introduce business innovation. You will need to do the same. Take a look at areas in your own organisation where business processes can be re-drawn to deliver business agility. Removing paper-based processes and applying digital technology to augment your middle or back-office operations is another area of digital transformation that can deliver clear, efficient outcomes. Past track record is no guarantee of future success. Your organisation may have been highly successful for many years, and you may be running systems that were best-of-breed when you implemented them, but the landscape has changed. Today, advances in digital technologies allow you to provision services on-demand, scale rapidly and design your applications differently. Many of these technologies are now mature enough to deliver enterprise-grade services, and some of the largest companies in the world today depend on them to run their global operations. It is therefore time for you to review your technology stack. Look for opportunities to modernise your IT infrastructure and systems to take full advantage of new digital capabilities. How can you move to the cloud, what should you move to the cloud? How can cloud technologies improve your business? These are the conversations you need to start having now. The decreasing cost of data storage has made it easier for organisations to collect more and more data. However, data quantity does not automatically translate into useful insights that can support decision-making. Despite the amount of data that some organisations are collecting, their lines of business may still be far from making data-driven decisions. One reason could be that they do not know why they are collecting the data that they are collecting, how they can extract useful and actionable insights from it and, most importantly, connect those insights to make sound business decisions. If this is the situation in your organisation, it is time to develop a robust data strategy. You need a proper plan to ensure you are making the right investments in data and analytics to fuel your business.

What does “mobile-centric” really mean? Positive disruption to public services Breaking down silos Transforming ecosystems How to get started explore more 
                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  Six out of seven billion people on this planet have mobile phones and they are using it not only to communicate but also to transact. According to a  , more than 62 per cent of those with smartphones have made a purchase using their mobile devices in the past six months. As your organisation embarks on digital transformation, this is an important factor to keep in mind. Increasingly, your customers, business partners and employees will be interacting and transacting with you on their mobile devices such as smart phones and tablets. So as you re-think your business models and redesign your processes for digital transformation, it is wise to put mobile centricity front and centre of your considerations. Mobile centricity simply means delivering an omni-channel experience that leverages mobile capabilities and technologies to enhance the entire user experience and not just the smart phone experience. This allows users to access online contents and transact seamlessly using their hand-held mobile devices or kiosks. With a mobile centric approach, you are making use of mobile devices as your main platform to drive digital transformation. The user experience that you create on mobile devices must be just as effective, if not more so, than any other user touchpoint. But it is also important to think about mobile devices and platforms not just as another customer channel but also as an all-encompassing strategy for breaking down silos, leveraging next-generation technologies and innovating for the future. This mindset has helped to revolutionise business and operating models for some private sector enterprises (think Netflix and mobile banking) and also transformed the way public agencies engage with the community and deliver services to citizens. In Singapore, agencies like the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF), Singapore Police Force and Land Transport Authority (just to name a few) have adopted mobile-centric strategies to inform, engage and empower citizens and customers. The SGSecure app launched by the Ministry of Home Affairs allows the Police and the SCDF to alert users to major emergencies such as terrorist attacks and public order incidents. It also allows users to inform the agencies of major incidents via text, photos or videos using mobile devices, empowering them to play a critical role in homeland security. Another app by SCDF, myResponder, notifies members of the public – also known as Community First Responders – of cardiac arrest and fire cases within 400m of their location, as well as the location of the nearest AEDs. This helps save lives by bringing together the community and agency to render assistance. To better serve the needs of commuters and road users beyond providing information through the LTA website, LTA’s app MyTransport.SG provides user-centric features such as a multi-modal journey planner, alerts and a host of other functions to deliver personalised travel experiences to bus and MRT users, motorists, cyclists and pedestrians. It is important to note that the pivotal aspect of a mobile-centric strategy is not just about rolling out applications via mobile platforms; it is about breaking down silos in the back end so that the data and applications can come together to deliver user-centric services. Take LTA’s MyTransport.SG app for example. It is powered by LTA Data Mall, a platform that brings together a wide variety of land transport-related datasets for stakeholders (enterprises, third-party developers, researchers, and other members of the public) to co-create innovative and inclusive transport solutions. The information that MyTransport.SG provides to its users (such as road conditions, bus arrival times etc) is taken from the LTA Data Mall. If mobile technology is viewed as the car driving digital transformation, data is the fuel that is powering it. It is the combination of mobile technology and data that sets the stage for a mobile-centric digital transformation. This can be a very powerful catalyst for change. Beyond impacting individual organisations, the combination can also serve as a platform for transforming entire ecosystems. The transport sector is a case in point. The combination of mobile technology and data paves the way for a disruptive transformation of the transport ecosystem that shifts the operating paradigm away from personally-owned modes of transportation towards the provision of Mobility-as-a-Service (referring to transportation). This is enabled by combining transportation services from public and private transportation providers through a unified gateway that creates and manages each trip, which users can pay for with a single account. So a commuter could potentially use an application on his mobile device to plan his end-to-end journey by taking the MRT, then picking up a bicycle at the MRT station to ride to his destination. Such are the possibilities and opportunities that open up with a mobile-centric business strategy. But where does your organisation begin on this journey? Here are a few principles to help jump-start the process: With these considerations in mind, start developing a proper strategy and plan for your organisation to embark on a mobile-first digital transformation. You need to make sure that you are making the right investments in mobile technologies to power your business into the future.

"Effective use of threat intelligence requires a new, integrated security model that will be able to address cyber challenges in this era of digital transformation." explore more 
                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  Digital transformation elevates the challenges for cybersecurity as attack surfaces expand with increased connectivity and growing volumes of data flowing in and out of enterprise networks. And to a certain extent, how well organisations manage these challenges and operationalise threat intelligence can be mirrored in where they stand on the IDC Digital Transformation (DX) MaturityScape . In a Singtel-commissioned whitepaper on “Digital Transformation in the Intelligence Economy”, IDC describes, at the one end, “digitally distraught” organisations with DX initiatives that are tactical and disconnected from a larger enterprise strategy. At the other end of the MaturityScape, we see “digitally determined” organisations with DX initiatives are integrated, continuous, and have a transformative impact across the organisation. In the cybersecurity space, the “digitally determined” are those who are able to make use of threat intelligence in an integrated and continuous fashion to improve risk management efficiency and effectiveness, automate remediation tasks, and establish a central threat management service for the organisation. However, despite a big push in recent years to set up security operations centres, acquire new threat detection technologies and make better use of threat intelligence, many are still “distraught”. And the main reason is that they are attempting to operationalise threat intelligence across a multitude of point tools and manual processes. This becomes a problem as the number of data sources continues to grow, together with the sheer volume and increased sophistication of threats that organisations encounter on a day-to-day basis. Without the ability to integrate and consolidate threat data and to automate analysis, organisations will soon reach “alert fatigue”. So, what are the key steps to take – and factors to consider – when developing an operational model that will enable organisations to make effective use of threat intelligence? As with DX, the first thing to do is to get executive sponsorship and establish an open dialogue between IT - in this case, cybersecurity - and business leaders within the organisation. Leaders who define common goals and measure progress with metrics are able to determine acceptable levels of risk that translate into the most efficient deployment of a company’s limited IT resources. They will be able to drive policy-making decisions and ensure that these policies are translated into strong change management processes, disciplined access control mechanisms, and automated authorisation and verification rules. When building an operational model for security, the business-security dialogue will help ensure that there is executive backing for the integration effort that is needed before organisations can optimise their use of threat intelligence. The effective use of threat intelligence will require organisations to have centralised oversight of intelligence programmes and feeds, and visibility into who is using the intelligence and for what purpose. This means integrating all the threat intelligence onto one platform to help the organisation to identify redundancies and inefficiencies, and rationalise what is being used, by who, and how. The operational model will also have to ensure that threat intelligence is delivered at the right time to the right audience. As ESG pointed out in a research report , “threat intelligence is only good when it’s relevant, and it’s only relevant when it comes at the right time and provides proper context.” Good threat intelligence should also simplify decisions on how organisations should respond to threats. And this requires the use of analytics to process threat data into usable information. A good analytics tool with smart customisation options will be able to identify patterns and zoom in on bona fide threats instead of raising an alert at every flagged keyword. It will enable data to be sorted, filtered and combined to get a more accurate picture of the threats facing the organisation. ESG cited the example of a piece of binary data like an IP address taken from a threat feed, which might be combined with more information about a rogue domain, a recent sighting of that IP by a honeypot, and a tweet that suggests an attack might have come from it. “A solution that is able to see the link between these disparate threads will provide far more context, allowing users to make more informed decisions,” it said. Operationalising threat intelligence, therefore, requires organisations to have centralised oversight of the multitude of data feeds, and strong analytics capabilities to ensure that the intelligence is translated into insights that are timely, relevant and easily actionable. This will make the difference between the “determined” and the “distraught”.   Contact us at:  Share this article on: Discover how you can chart your career and elevate your skills.

Six steps to building a healthy cyber immune system | NCS SG six steps to building a healthy cyber immune system Contact Us Thank you for your interest. It’s all about the ecosystem Six steps to building a healthy cyber immune system 1. Hygiene 2. Visibility 3. Threat detection 4. Prediction 5. Response 6. Partner with an MSSP explore more 
                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  A cybersecurity strategy is similar to our biological immune systems. Threats grow in complexity even when our defences respond to contain them. A healthy cybersecurity ecosystem is vital to ensuring that your business stays protected from attacks.  It’s hard to ignore the similarities between cybersecurity systems and our own biological immune systems. Just like our bodies, threats grow in complexity even as the anatomy’s defences respond to contain them. With each attack, the immune system learns to improve its responses or is overwhelmed and succumbs to the attack. In both cases, keeping the component parts of the immune system’s defences in check is the key to ensuring a robust response and repelling attacks. A cybersecurity ecosystem comprises a diverse array of parts – computers, software, communications technologies, cyber devices and appliances, compliance and regulatory bodies/frameworks, processes, and people – that interact for multiple purposes. A healthy cybersecurity ecosystem will ensure all components are working together in near real-time to anticipate and prevent cyber attacks, limit the attack spread, mitigate the consequences, and restore systems and networks to a trusted state. Security capabilities are built into the cybersecurity infrastructure in a way that allows preventive and defensive courses of action to be coordinated within the corporate network with trusted information exchanges and shared, configurable policies. A healthy cyber ecosystem operates via layered defences and countermeasures that work in tandem, much like antibodies responding to a virus in our body. This ecosystem works from within the body (the corporate network), covering all vital functions (the whole enterprise), learns, adapts and remembers (identify and monitor threats, analyse and remediate, watch and prevent), and responds quickly (intervention). Setting out a blueprint for a healthy cybersecurity immune system requires a deeper understanding of the organisation’s security posture and how it maps against the business goals. Only then, can the enterprises assess if there are gaps in defences, and have a clearer picture of their security readiness. Here are six steps to include: Good hygiene precedes a strong and healthy cybersecurity immune system. This is a quality check on the individual components of the ecosystem to ensure they are fully functioning so the whole defence infrastructure doesn’t break down when attacked. This calls for regular security audits, investments in improving current defences, processes and protocols, and continuous training to keep security practitioners current at all times. For example, strengthen incident response by deploying a blue team environment that looks at ways to defend, change, and re-group security mechanisms. Other steps include network segmentation, perimeter protection, privilege and authentication controls, and asset isolation. Pervasive visibility is to a cybersecurity immune system what blood is to the human circulatory system. Without persistent visibility across both the physical and virtual (including hybrid clouds) networks, detection, prediction, and response will be weak at best. Establishing visibility into all systems at the network-packet and metadata level via a single pane of glass will allow security defences to contain the threat effectively. Much like how a virus spreads across organs in the human circulatory system, malware often targets lateral movement between vital computing systems and devices in the corporate network. Faced with good cyber hygiene, the malware will attempt to evade detection but with adequate threat identification capabilities, behavioural anomalies will be detected. The suspicious activity is triangulated and compared against known bad behaviour to identify the intruder. This process resembles many modern cybersecurity systems that adopt machine-learning (ML) technologies to learn, remember and adapt to combat viruses and bacteria, and to immunise the enterprise from further attacks. Additional steps include considerations of security processes and technical controls that are capable of identifying series threats that could be programmed to trigger an alarm. The next step to include is the development of predictive capabilities to identify motives. The motive behind attacks often reveal repeatable behavioural patterns that will allow the security infrastructure to respond appropriately. Many threats such as malware and command-and-control (C&C) server use the same codebase/framework to penetrate networks even if somewhat disguised or morphed. They share many of the same codebase characteristics and attack cycles, allowing the enterprise defences to predict intent before any damage is done. Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies are often deployed to uncover such behavioural patterns. Once the motive is uncovered, the appropriate incident response can be taken to contain the threat and for further analysis. Much of this is done manually today but with security orchestration and automation tools, these actions can be fully autonomous without additional human input. It’s always useful to seek the expertise of a Managed Security Services Provider (MSSP) to shore up your defences. Trustwave, a Singtel company, is a leading MSSP with industry-leading threat detection and responses services that provide 24X7 around-the-globe delivery, powered by Trustwave SpiderLabs®, and can be tailored to your security needs. Services include innovative SpiderLabs® security research capabilities, threat intelligence, monitoring of SOC, and an intuitive portal to automate cybersecurity management and response. Conventional security frameworks focus on keeping threats and attacks out or away from corporate networks. But with the speed and volume of cyber attacks available today, keeping out network intruders is increasingly difficult. A security framework or model targeted at working within the network, from inside the perimeter would provide comprehensive protection of the enterprise’s entire network infrastructure. Operating much like the human immune system, this new model will emphasise learning and adapting to threat vectors using technologies within. Accordingly, this cybersecurity immune system will respond quickly to provide complete coverage against an attack, detecting the malicious code, analysing it and mitigating the risk with an appropriate action.

                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way we live and interact. Safe distancing, temperature screening, checking-in and out of shops, malls, and offices are now common practice to help tackle the pandemic. As offices re-open, there is a heightened responsibility to ensure workplace safety and monitor the wellbeing of employees. As a rapid response measure, the Singapore Government introduced Safe Entry and TraceTogether. These apps have created the means for effective data collection used in contact tracing, as businesses of all types are required to enforce check-in and conduct temperature screening when people visit their premises. However, the collected data is not made available to organisations, resulting in the need for independent information gathering on the part of organisations themselves. With the aim of collecting data for informed decision-making, NCS created OneShield – a mobile application that helps organisations gather information about staff who have fallen ill. OneShield allows an organisation’s staff to conveniently apply for sick leave and update their health status online. With this solution, businesses can perform organisation-wide risk monitoring, place staff on quarantine if need be, and tackle the spread of the coronavirus amongst its own workforce. OneShield eliminates the need for staff to connect and access the office network to submit medical certificate and health status report. Staff can provide information in real-time while waiting to see a doctor, and their reporting officer is able to view and acknowledge health updates in an instant. This prevents managers from overlooking an acknowledgement request sent via email. Features of OneShield: To provide a bird’s eye view of the health situation in the organisation, a dashboard collates data and provides up-to-date information. This enables management, HR and pandemic committee to review and take action quickly to prevent the formation of a COVID-19 cluster. The dashboard was built around questions asked by the committee: With a data analytics dashboard, the pandemic committee can also determine which teams have the highest number of staff on medical leave, and if containment of that business unit needs to take place. Using the dashboard, the pandemic committee is easily able to judge the overall situation by seeing very quickly the key figures in their organisation’s staff. Trends in staff behaviour are easily spotted, and a corrective disease response plan can be quickly initiated to prevent infections across the workplace. Beyond the how, it is equally important to remember the purpose of this endeavour, which is to protect the workforce and restore freedoms. In other words, giving staff the option of going back to the office, with the knowledge that safeguards are in place that ensure a safe workplace for all. COVID-19 is highly contagious, spreading twice as fast as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), at a rate of 4 – 4.5 days, as reported by TodayOnline. We need to acknowledge that most organisations’ HR systems are not designed to respond to diseases of such rapid onset, and a new solution that integrates well is vital. Leaders must also take a proactive approach to streamline processes to monitor, detect and activate office safety plans. HR needs to have immediate access to an employee’s health status, and they need the analytics capabilities to provide them with organisation-wide visibility. Critical information must be accessible throughout the chain of command, in real-time, at any given point. Processes need to be re-designed for data to flow seamlessly, ensuring that relevant individuals are alerted, and immediate action takes place when a threat is identified. A better workflow supported by technologies like mobile applications and data analytics platforms can help to combat the coronavirus and ensure a smooth transition to our new way of working.  for a discussion on mobility solution for your business.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  The previously unbreakable "Iron Triangle of Healthcare" where the constraints are healthcare systems' top priorities – Cost, Quality and Access – can now be broken with the advent of digital innovations that increase healthcare access and quality without increasing cost or even lowering cost. The most common telehealth solution involves primary care consultations that take place online (e.g., chat, video conferencing, etc.) via a portal or a mobile app. These also incorporate appointment scheduling, provision of digital medical certificates and medication delivery. In Singapore, approximately ten telehealth companies are active in this space and employ inhouse doctors or a panel of doctors to offer the service. A 60-70% surge in demand for these services was seen due to COVID-19. Other prominent solutions focus on pre-consultation. For example, Babylon Health offers a symptom checker and AI/ML driven diagnosis recommendations to patients. The current landscape for healthcare innovations involves two entities: on one hand, healthcare institutions engaged in their own digital transformation efforts and on the other, digital disruptors. Healthcare institutions' motivations for innovation are to improve patient experience, stay relevant and support the changing care model (i.e., remote care and monitoring). Generally, they are slower to innovate as they need to decide which services to digitalise, but they have the innate ability to offer more in-depth healthcare services. Their challenge leans more toward of how to strike a balance between online or in-person services. Some institutions implement research and development programmes to trial new solutions in their institutions or partner innovative startups with new digital solutions. Digital disruptors, on the other hand, comprise healthtech and medtech startups and alliances intent on disrupting the status quo with a new business model (i.e., provide quality but cheaper and more accessible care). Many are financed by venture capitalists (VC) and series funding. They are quicker to innovate and deploy telehealth solutions but their continued growth involves offering more services through partnering or by acquisitions. It is no wonder that telehealth is a key focus seeing as the global telemedicine market size is forecasted to grow to USD175.5 billion by 2026 .    A global trend gaining traction is telcos in health  seeking to be the enabler to bridge the different ecosystem proponents such as consumers, healthcare service providers and the payors through high-speed networks (e.g., 5G) and differentiated connectivity services. One example of telcos in this space is FarEasTone from Taiwan, which collaborated with the Taitung County government and other agencies to increase accessibility in healthcare services to rural areas. A self-developed remote diagnosis and treatment service platform connects with IOT medical equipment used by clinicians at local public health centres.  This data (physiological and observation images) is transmitted via 5G to the cloud to specialists in large medical centres to conduct remote disease diagnosis. NCS sees opportunities to expand teleconsult capabilities to include remote diagnosis and monitoring tools to accurately assess and diagnose a wider variety of conditions and detect adverse events.  Hence, NCS has started developing fall prevention and robotics solutions in this space. Another area to focus on is cybersecurity. With the imminent increase of IOT and connected devices supporting telehealth, security solutions are vital to prevent hacking and data/information leaks to ensure safety of patients.

                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  A globalising, interconnected world is elevating industrial IT and Operational Technology (OT) security to the forefront of today’s boardroom agenda. Specifically, the hardware and software used in the production area on factory floors, utility plants and electrical grids, water supplies, and in many engineering and research and development facilities. Several high profile security breaches in power plants and other critical infrastructure have served to escalate OT security concerns in recent months. This is especially important, because the digital transformation of industry will cause more convergence between IT and OT systems. Connectivity between the systems will increase to facilitate more efficient business processes, and this increases the attack surface and the vectors available to reach OT systems. But what are the real threats facing user companies and what should they prioritise for cyber defences? What unique concerns and challenges (external and internal factors) are impacting industrial cybersecurity? What strategies and measures are available to secure these vital assets? There are clear headwinds approaching OT security that senior management should be aware of. Escalating cyber threats in the industrial sectors and changes in legislation have heightened the profile of OT security recently. For example, the power supply disruptions in Ukraine in 2015 and 2016 triggered by cyber attacks on the country’s electricity distribution and transmission systems sent shockwaves across the globe. The incidents and others like them have reinforced how cyber attacks in the OT and Industrial Control Systems (ICS) space can severely impact organisations, even the physical functioning of society. Ransomware attacks such as Petya and NotPetya have also shut down manufacturing lines and affected banking, government and airport operations. More recently, the analysis of malware targeted at OT systems such as Industroyer and Triton has increased awareness of cyber threats to industrial control systems. We now have a better understanding of the impact such threats can unleash, including physical infrastructure.” Another major driver behind the renewed focus on OT security is the changing legislative landscape. The introduction of the Cybersecurity Bill and its associated Code of Practice in Singapore, for example, has influenced the rising focus on OT Security in Singapore. These legislative changes mandate that all ICS must be assessed, tested and monitored consistently. Prioritising security as a matter of policy drives organisations to relook the security practices they have in place. While OT and ICS security are receiving much needed attention, many affected organisations face significant hurdles. One of these is visibility over the assets that run the OT systems and visibility over the security of those assets. Without visibility, organisations struggle to identify the security posture of their system. In the area of ICS, many organisations are struggling with managing legacy software, proprietary systems and distributed ownership as they seek to deploy security solutions that may not be compatible with older systems. Organisations must recognise that attack surfaces in ICS are different. It’s critical to identify cybersecurity products and vendors that understand the context of this space, and offer solutions that can work with and not against these systems. Organisations can improve the protection of their OT systems by ensuring that any systems upgrade or new systems built adhere to a security-by-design process. That means that all hardware and software as well as protocols and workflows are designed to be secure. This requires incorporating OT priorities in cybersecurity practices: OT and ICS security practitioners must accept that malicious practices are inevitable. Organisations are better off being prepared with strong understanding of the risks, putting risk mitigations in place, ensuring visibility through monitoring, and maintaining a trained workforce with robust incident handling processes. 1) Risk assessment Start with a risk assessment of the resident risks in the OT and ICS. Taking stock of OT system assets is an important first step to instituting better protection and monitoring practices. Plan and implement mitigation measures with an understanding that OT systems are built to last and are designed with different priorities, often with physical safety and availability being paramount and highly prioritised. For example, many OT systems were designed at a time when OT systems were not accessible remotely. The security measures put in place may not consider for new remote access connectivity. Finally, expand security policies, such as implementing post-breach procedures that are appropriate and sensible in an OT/ICS environment. 2) Visibility With ICS and OT environments consisting of many types of equipment, often with Industrial Internet of Things co-existing with legacy Industrial Control Systems, getting a centralised view is difficult. The greater scope of asset types and legacy equipment presents challenges that traditional IT environments do not encounter. OT networks are getting increasingly connected and complex. The greater attack surface elevates the importance of monitoring and at the same time, making monitoring itself even more challenging. While security tools for IT and OT vary, monitoring and threat detection should be simplified as much as possible through smart aggregator platforms that provide useful information in ‘a single pane of glass’, Better visibility and continuous monitoring of systems to identify breaches quickly and start incident investigations should be mandatory for organisations with OT and ICS environments. 3) Upgrading skills Organisations should also invest in upskilling teams to ensure cybersecurity practices are relevant and up to date. Cybersecurity knowledge and skillsets can no longer be confined to only the IT teams. Non-IT personnel, including OT engineering and production teams, need to be included in cybersecurity processes, such as incident reporting, handling and management. They are essential to ensuring a more cyber secure organisation. Organisations can look for security partners that have experience in OT and ICS, to ensure that cybersecurity best practices are upheld. These can include scenario-based OT security training courses involving offensive and defensive operations that integrate real and simulated exercises. Such training can be customised to cover water, power, transportation, and manufacturing for more realistic visualisation and adoption, to counter OT and ICS cyber-attacks effectively. 4) Security Partnerships In all of these, organisations can turn to security partners that have experience in securing OT and ICS. Ensuring the security and resilience of OT and ICS is a shared responsibility among multiple stakeholders, internally and externally, because no one person or entity has the knowledge, authority or resources to do it alone. For many ICS environments, it’s not a matter of if an attack will take place, but when. In 20171, the Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT) identified 753 vulnerabilities through its 137 architecture design reviews, and many more went unreported or undetected. Attacks on ICS installations are increasing in frequency and complexity; building a network with a hardened perimeter is no longer adequate. Securing ICSs against modern threats requires well-planned and well-implemented strategies to quickly and effectively detect, counter, and expel attackers. At Trustwave, we offer a variety of services to secure OT and ICS through our consultancy services, including risks and vulnerability assessments, and penetration testing, to assess the security posture of the organisation. Trustwave’s advisory consulting team helps organisations transform and mature their security operations, offering managed threat detection (MTD) that covers both IT and ICS security monitoring. Our managed threat detection service covers use cases and analytics that are focused on identifying cyber security incidents in ICS environments. Last but not least, Trustwave conducts classes on OT security to assist OT engineers in improving their cybersecurity awareness.

                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  When Covid-19 hit Singapore, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) faced the challenge of having to monitor and manage a fast-evolving situation that was impacting hundreds of thousands of migrant workers staying in dormitories of varying sizes across Singapore. This created an urgent need for a comprehensive and easy-to-use digital application to track the health of migrant workers, provide them with prompt access to medical consultation, and allow MOM to better manage and plan the deployment of its officers and medical teams. Time was of the essence. The application had to be built very quickly and, given the unpredictable nature of the Covid-19 situation, it had to easily adaptable to be able to keep pace with the necessary changes in rules, policies and practices for managing an evolving pandemic. To develop the app in the shortest possible time, NCS quickly assembled a team of subject matter experts and technical specialists in areas such as cloud and mobile app development. A two-week sprint cycle was adopted, and NCS worked closely with key users and counterparts from GovTech’s Information Systems and Technology Department to identify the requirements, develop the functionalities and deliver changes quickly when needed as the Covid-19 situation evolved. The FWMOMCare app was built using the latest mobile and cloud-based technologies and made available on the iOS, Android and Huawei stores to cover the majority of devices used by the migrant workers. We made sure that the app had simple screen interfaces that were easy to navigate. This would allow the workers to make use of the app on a daily basis without complicating their routine. To cater to different groups of migrant workers, the app is available in eight different languages (English, Mandarin, Bengali, Tamil, Thai, Indonesian Bahasa, Tagalog, Vietnamese). The first iteration of the app was rolled out to users within a month. Numerous enhancements have since been made to keep the app up to date to keep pace with changing pandemic requirements. As of February 2022, there were more than 1.1 million downloads of FWMOMCare. The app, which currently has more than 20 functions, is used by hundreds of thousands of migrant workers each day. It allows them to submit their health status and Antigen Rapid Test results, and links those who are unwell with a 24/7 telemedicine service for prompt medical consultation. The app also provides them with the latest news and announcements to keep them up-to-date on the pandemic situation in Singapore.  FWMOMCare is also an important source of critical data for other systems which allow MOM to better monitor the health and movement of migrant workers for effective contact tracing and improved pandemic management. A backend system allows MOM officers to share news, create new surveys, send push notifications and perform administrative tasks on the migrant worker’s data, such as updating their mobile numbers. The rapid development and deployment of the app enabled MOM to start monitoring the health of migrant workers quickly and improved the management of the Covid-19 situation in dormitories. Empowering workers to report their own health status and submit ART results in a timely fashion via the app also ensured that resources that would have had to be deployed to monitor these processes could be redirected to other needs. Workers could self-isolate and seek medical help if their ART result was positive. Easy access to medical consultation as well as regular updates on Covid-19 developments also helped to allay any fear and uncertainty that they had over the pandemic. The app also captures the workers’ vaccination status so they know whether they are allowed to go to work, and they can use it to check-in and out at the dormitories. From an operational perspective, this enables MOM to better monitor the flow of migrant workers between the dormitories and their workplace, and facilitates contact tracing and outbreak management. The sharing of data with other MOM systems also allows employers to view their workers’ status, which helps in resource planning and deployment. As one of the main sources of data for monitoring the health status of migrant workers, the app continues to play a key role in managing the pandemic. It provides MOM with better visibility into the impact of Covid-19 and enables all stakeholders to take data-driven actions to curtail its spread.

                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  Work is perhaps one of the areas of life that has been most shaken up by the Covid-19 pandemic. The shift to remote or hybrid working has caused many to re-evaluate the traditional 9-to-5 office-based working model. As Covid restrictions are being relaxed, many organisations have opted to continue with flexible work arrangements. At the same time, many employers are thinking about how to attract and retain talent in light of the Great Resignation, a trend where workers are quitting their jobs   due to a range of factors, including job dissatisfaction, wage stagnation, and more. Employers now need to be more accommodating of employees’ needs than ever before. This includes offering them more choice regarding how and where they work. According to a study conducted by Accenture,   of people who feel they can be productive anywhere plan to stay with their company for a long time. Meanwhile,   found that 73 percent of workers want flexible remote work options to continue while 67 percent want more in-person time with their teams. According to the same study, 66 percent of business decision makers are considering redesigning physical spaces to make them more suited to hybrid work environments. Employers in Singapore have been encouraged to permanently offer flexible work arrangements. A   released by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM), the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC), and the Singapore National Employers Federation (SNEF) earlier this year said that such arrangements help employees “achieve better work-life harmony and promote a more engaged and productive workforce.” Connected buildings represent the next step in creating workplaces that can meet the expectations of today’s workers.   The spaces where we work have a big impact on our ability to excel at our jobs. Hence, many forward-thinking organisations are reimagining these spaces and equipping them with new technologies to ensure that they are more conducive to employees’ wellbeing, creativity, and productivity, and that they foster greater collaboration. Google, for example, uses “ ” to make workspaces reconfigurable according to changing needs. The pods consist of office furniture which can be easily moved into different arrangements. Microsoft, meanwhile, has designed   that allow remote and office-based workers to easily interact with one another. When deploying technology in the workplace, it’s important to ensure that it is delivering the intended benefits and allowing employees to do their jobs better. Organisations need to look at how employees are using existing technology in the workplace so that they know how and where to deploy new technologies for maximum effect. “Technology shouldn’t be adopted for its own sake,” says Tan Chien Mien, Lead of NCS Engineering. “It should help employees complete their tasks more effectively and make their work easier and more enjoyable.” Organisations are increasingly incorporating smart features in their office buildings to improve the overall user experience. For example, there is a   which uses nearly 30,000 sensors to gather data like temperature, humidity, occupancy, and light levels. The data is analysed in real-time and the insights generated are used to automatically adjust the lighting, air conditioning, and so on to ensure that the building’s occupants are comfortable at all times.    Creating these connected buildings requires leveraging big data and techniques like machine learning (ML) while ensuring that different elements of the infrastructure work together in a seamless, secure, and reliable manner. 
  Besides providing a better user experience, connected buildings allow organisations to cut costs and reduce their environmental impact.  For example, sensor data can reveal water usage patterns which can be used to save water. “Let's say the usage of the water is higher on a particular day, then we know that there is something amiss, and further investigation can be done,” Tan says. “There could be some leakage somewhere. Without the data, it is not possible to identify an abnormality in the whole ecosystem.” Likewise, lighting and air-conditioning systems that automatically adjust to the number of people working in a certain area can help optimise electricity usage.   It is not just office spaces that are evolving to meet the needs of a new generation of tech-savvy workers. Workplaces of all kinds are being transformed by smart technologies and high connectivity. Take Singapore’s Changi airport, for instance. To ensure that there are enough taxis available for arriving passengers at any given time, a   keeps track of the number of taxis queueing at all four terminals as well as the number of flights arriving each hour. When the supply of taxis is about to fall short of demand, the team alerts taxi drivers via a purpose-built app called Cabs@Changi. The airport is also trialling ground sensors at taxi stands to collect real-time data on passenger numbers. NCS has partnered with Marina Bay Cruise Centre Singapore (MBCCS) to create Asia’s first  . The deployed crowd-management solution uses data science, video analytics, and predictive artificial intelligence (AI) to monitor passenger traffic and detect bottlenecks and other issues in real time. Insights gathered from smart devices are used to optimise resource planning, improve operational efficiency, and tighten the security of the terminal. For example, when the check-in queue is slow-moving, the system will automatically trigger an alert to operators so that they can respond by opening more counters. Alerts will also be sent to operators to attend to emergency incidents. In the retail space, Singtel has launched  , an unmanned portable 24/7 store which allows customers to purchase products using a self-service kiosk. Customers can interact with a concierge robot or chat virtually with remote human staff.   Workplace security can be greatly improved by leveraging AI and big data. Leong notes, for instance, that intelligent technologies can grant people access to a building or specific areas within a building based on multiple forms of authentication, such as iris or face recognition. Tan adds that these technologies can make the onboarding process smoother — new employees can send in a photo before their first day of work so that the facial recognition system can identify them from the moment they first show up. Tan also points out that smart technology can assist security officers. Data collected from sensors can be used to provide officers with remote real-time updates. Officers can be alerted to what is going on in all areas of a building at all times. Moreover, using video analytics, officers can be automatically alerted to suspicious objects or behaviour, thus reducing the need to make regular patrols. It is even possible to have robots patrol crowded areas to detect and prevent illegal, dangerous, or anti-social behaviour. In Toa Payoh, Singapore, a robot called   has been deployed to monitor the public areas and alert the command centre when it detects offences such as illegal hawking and smoking in prohibited areas. The robot can also issue warnings via voice messages and an onboard interactive dashboard. However, big data brings its own set of challenges in terms of security and privacy. IT systems can be hacked and many people are rightly concerned about the potential for misuse of their personal information. Hence, it is important that organisations invest in strong cyber security and develop a robust data governance strategy.     As the nature of office and city life continues to change, it is clear that the workspaces and public spaces of the future will look radically different to the ones we have today. Employers will have to harness the benefits of smart buildings and smart workspaces to give employees greater flexibility and make it easier for them to collaborate with their colleagues, whether in person or through digital platforms. Increasingly, organisations need to cast their recruitment nets beyond the geographical areas in which they are based and include more remote and hybrid workers in their talent pools. To attract such workers, they need to ensure that they have the proper digital infrastructure in place. It goes without saying that smart technologies will play a central role in the workplace of tomorrow. However, if organisations want to see good employee retention they will need to ensure that the technologies they deploy in the workplace properly serve the needs of their employees and that they foster meaningful connections and build trust between everyone in the organisation.   NCS SG, Global Delivery Lead Share this article on: Thank you for your enquiry!

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  Back to the Future with Smart Retail. The pandemic has set in motion a rethink of our relationship with physical spaces, from factories to retail spaces, during the lockdowns of 2020, most of these physical spaces, and supposedly "essential" real estate were left largely vacant. Retail shops and the wave of closures across cities worldwide could almost serve as the poster child for the impact of the pandemic–even Microsoft’s physical stores were shut down around the US. Yet business seemed to continue as usual. Brands and retailers which had a dominant position online, and those who were able to pivot to digital-first touchpoints, even fared better. But as the world reopens, will ecommerce continue to hold Its sway over consumers? Or will shoppers be back to business as usual at physical stores? The future might actually be more of the same but different.   Foot traffic is a key factor of any successful retail store. And increasing customer traffic to physical stores is a constant challenge. Once in, retailers need to have accurate counts of customer foot traffic at any given moment, and a keen understanding of customers' in-store experience–all valuable data points that many stores are still missing. What’s next? To plug the gaps in visibility and efficiency, industry leaders and innovators are turning to video analytics and any existing investments in IoT they may have to deliver what can be known as "Smart Retail". The advantages of smart retail applications are extensive, including in-store customer shopping experience, smarter retail check-out management and layout optimisation, prevent shrinkage / loss prevention, augment demand forecasting and inventory management strategies using in-store demographic data. "Effective aisle management can make or break sales. With insights into aisles that are popular, the customer dwell times in each of them, and demographics of the customers captured through video analytics, you can adopt a proactive and agile approach to merchandising," he added. The ability to now accurately analyse and engineer foot traffic allows store owners to ensure their business operations are as efficient as possible, allowing for easier decision making and improved sales numbers. By optimising their merchandising, they naturally optimise shelf-space, and are better positioned to offer promotions–sometimes in real time–combined with loyalty programs that are tailored to shoppers which their video analytics systems "recognise" to design more personalised, rewarding, and engaging shopping experiences. It’s no surprise then, that global apparel brands such as H&M for are making fast moves into the smart retail space, turning to AI for more informed inventory management, agile merchandising, and stocking popular items based on insights from purchases and store receipts. Indoor positioning systems (IPS) also play a pivotal role in enabling smart retail. They have been instrumental in helping users navigate indoor areas where GPS is not available or not accurate enough. Hong Kong International Airport uses this technology in their “HKG My Flight” mobile application. Similarly, in the retail industry, Lowes and Target are utilising this technology as well, to pinpoint where and how customers navigate their stores. A   by Gartner projected that 65% of enterprises will require indoor location asset tracking by 2022. For retailers, indoor positioning systems or indoor asset tracking technologies more visibility into supply chains, opening the way for more efficient manufacturing, packaging & shipping, and storage. A well-designed asset tracking strategy will position retailers, and brands to streamline supply chains and achieve more agility in adapting to demand dynamics, and procurement decisions. For large retailers, a smart asset tracking solution covering hundreds of thousands of individual items will reap significant cost savings and untold operational efficiencies.         The advantages of smart retail applications powered by video analytics, IoT, and Indoor Positioning Systems among others, are clearly extensive. In-store customer shopping experiences can be extended to support immersive AR experiences, while smarter retail check-out management and layout optimisation would streamline costs, accelerate sales turnover, and simplify last-mile shopping experiences. Ironically, ecommerce giants are also the ones spearheading smart retail spaces.   to offer an option for customers to “Smile to Pay”, where facial recognition, coupled with existing records of businesses and their payment information allow cashless and intuitive checkouts. This initiative has included the $2.6 billion acquisition of the Intime department store chain, with 62 locations across 33 Chinese in addition to the opening of around 100  . "Video analytics and IoT are key technologies that drive "New Retail", a termed coined by Alibaba's Jack Ma. Stores may increasingly leverage video analytics and AI to design smarter, real-time, and personalised in-store shopping experiences for their customers," James Wong, Senior Partner of Global Business at NCS.   If smart retail is the new retail, how can existing property owners and retailers reposition for this future? The switch may be simpler than most think. Property owners who have already made investments in  , can renew their competitive edge and real estate portfolio by swiftly switching to smart retail offerings for tenants. "Landlords and real estate services providers present themselves as ready partners who can offer an almost "plug-and-play" smart retail platform for retailers and brands that seek to launch future-ready in-store experiences for customers,” says Wong. At the time of writing, the   is projected to reach USD 30.730 billion by the end of 2026, with a CAGR of 13.7% in the 2021–2026 period, signalling an accelerating rise in smart retail technologies investments and just how pervasive smart retail could be in the near future. So just when it seems that physical retail spaces are seemingly threatened with obsoletion, connected buildings offers a new horizon of opportunities, and a smarter future that may effectively lift all boats, including those of property owners, real estate services providers, brands, and retailers.     NCS HK, Head Share this article on: Thank you for your enquiry!

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  Pandemic safety measures needed to be extended to the maritime sector in Singapore, to provide shore-based workers with the same protection as they’d be given in land-based roles. NCS worked with the maritime authority to design and quickly deploy SmartEntry@sea for shore-based personnel to check-in and check-out, extending the digital check-in system and contact tracing to seafarers. Every 2-3 minutes, a ship arrives or leaves Singapore – and every one of them requires shore-based personnel to carry out essential work onboard. Chandlering, bunkering, repairs and maintenance, surveys and inspections; it’s all critical to keeping the port open and supply chains flowing. In order to manage the risks of keeping so many people in contact with so many ships during a pandemic, a smart entry app is needed to be adapted to protect this fluid, complex workforce. NCS partnered with the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) to design, develop and commission SmartEntry@Sea– an integrated solution extending Singapore’s smart entry digital check-in system to the maritime sector. Fast, flexible thinking and dynamic development helped deliver a solution in an extraordinarily short timeframe under pandemic conditions. SmartEntry@SEA now enables all maritime stakeholders and users to comply with the robust, seamless and user-centric processes.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  NCS partnered with the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) to launch a digital platform that serves as a single portal for all port related documentations. This has helped create a greater user experience, and a safer, more efficient port. To date, an estimated savings of 100,000 manhours have been achieved by industry.  Prior to the implementation of MPA’s digitalPORT@SGTM, up to 16 forms for port clearance were submitted to three government agencies separately through their respective digital portals. This resulted in repetitive data entry and duplicate sets of documents submitted by the port users. Furthermore, the coordination between the three agencies on the clearance statuses was done through separate systems and workflows, which could result in delays to a ship’s arrival or departure. MPA partnered NCS to deploy digitalPORT@SGTM, a single and seamless portal for all port-related documentation, to be used by multiple agencies and maritime industry stakeholders, and which complies with the government’s requirement. MPA’s digitalPORT@SGTM simplifies the submission of port clearance to MPA, ICA and NEA for all arriving and departing ships through a single platform and streamlines 16 different forms into one simplified submission. Since the launch of its first phase in 2019, the shipping community has saved 100,000 hours per annum, thanks to faster and simpler submission of port clearance documents.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  Outdated and unsupported technology disallowed the existing Bonds Management System to be digitalised. Furthermore, the bond management processes were very manual, and paper based. Dialog, an NCS company, did an overhaul and delivered a fully digitalised and secured system for landlords and tenants to interact directly online. The system resulted in improved efficiencies in processes, and a better user experience for all. The existing legacy back-office system for managing bonds was based on outdated and unsupported technology and could not be extended to provide online capabilities. The bond management processes were also paper based and required extensive manual processing. The result was a highly inefficient back-office process and very poor customer service. Dialog delivered a full application lifecycle project from requirements confirmation to deployment. The highly secured system provides extensive back-office functionality and online services that allow landlords and tenants to interact directly with the system without the need for paper forms. The project also included an entirely new hardware and software environment designed to sustain the application over years of operation and designed to be fully fault tolerant. There was greatly improved back-office efficiencies and a vastly better end user experience for staff as well as for tenants, landlords and agents. Share this article on: Thank you for your enquiry!

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  After experiencing two winters, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly driving developments in technology and businesses, from autonomous vehicles to medical diagnosis, moving AI from theory to commercial applications. These innovative applications are increasingly important and becoming more prevalent in society. Common areas where AI are found to be effective and efficient include analysis of huge amount of data and information in a consistent and speedy manner; or when mundane operational tasks can be automated.  In the healthcare industry,  AI has been utilized to reduce time spent on administrative and operational tasks such as claims processing and patient administration among others. This helps to free up healthcare workers’ time and can be channelled to improving patients’ care and experiences. AI can also help to break the iron triangle of healthcare (triple constraints on Quality, Access and Cost).  For example, in telemedicine, AI-triage consultations and medications help to provide access to rural areas patients (or urban cities with serious traffic congestions), at an affordable cost and with similar qualities as a physical doctor’s visit.  Across the healthcare spectrum, the implementation of the appropriate AI tech can add value to clinicians, administrative staff and of course, the patient.  Given its highly infectious nature and easy transmission of COVID-19 through human contact or exposed surfaces, the use of robots and AI can help greatly reduce the potential of coronavirus transmission by reducing human contact, protecting frontline healthcare workers, administrative staff and the public at large. NCS has deployed AI-powered thermal cameras with several public healthcare providers in Singapore. Given the manpower crunch at these healthcare facilities, the use of these cameras helped to reduce the need for manpower required to carry out manual, one-to-one temperature measurements with handheld scanners.  These cameras can be integrated to the visitor and employee management system and contact tracing systems to facilitate monitoring and further follow-ups as required by the healthcare providers.  At the Community Care Facility (CCF) located at the Singapore Expo to manage recovering COVID-19 patients with milder symptoms, NCS co-implemented Robotic Process Automation (RPA) solution to automate the admission, discharge and transfer of patients into/out CCF, which was previously done through a manual data entry method. “The RPA solution helped to improve operational efficiency at the CCF, which had an indirect impact on the patient experience,” explained Jim Lim, Healthcare Sector Lead, NCS. NCS’ Robot Health Manager helped in the remote surveillance of persons to detect unwell persons using audio and video analytics (for quick isolation or attention). The self-navigating robot identifies Persons of Interest (POI) contactless vital signs monitoring (temp, heart rate), sound and gesture sensors to detect cough. “As a key technology partner with over 30 years of solutioning experience in the healthcare sector, NCS is committed to building our NEXT digital capabilities to meet the current and future needs for public and private healthcare institutions in Singapore,” said Jim. In the clinical setting, AI can be applied to great effect in areas of medical imaging such as CT scans and X-rays, in providing radiologists better insights and helping them make informed decisions. Thanks to advancement in deep learning technology in AI, it can analyze complicated medical images to better aid clinicians in detection and diagnostics.  NCS Corp Labs’ in-house researchers leverage the latest tech, including AI and they co-innovate with local research institutions such as Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and public healthcare clusters with an aim to reduce administrative and operational tasks by healthcare workers. “We are also working on the SG Health Assistive and Robotics Programme (SHARP), together with the National Research Foundation (NRF) and Ministry of Health (MOH) to increase the use of assistive and robotic tech in healthcare, as well as to reduce the burden of repetitive tasks,” said Dr. Yan Shi Xing, Director, Corporate Labs and Product Development, NCS. He shared that while China is leading in the area of medical AI and has many organizations involved in the training of AI models, the AI governance framework in Singapore emphasizes on responsibility and reliability.  “Although AI and deep neural networks can help predict outcomes, there may be occurrences of black box AI where the outputs and operations are not explainable. In the context of healthcare, explainable AI is a very important topic,” he added. This is also why Singapore takes a very cautious approach in applying AI in healthcare, especially in the clinical context. Outside of the clinical setting, the use of AI can also add value to both patients and healthcare professionals in the entire healthcare journey. For instance, to improve the overall patient experience, AI can be used to automate repetitive processes, process huge data in minimal time, and without human error. Overseas companies like UK’s Babylon Health and China’s Ping An Good Doctor use AI chatbots for the initial triaging of patients symptoms and conditions, saving time and bring convenience to consumers/patients.  At Singapore’s Tan Tock Seng Hospital, patients get their medication in 10 minutes and that includes the time they take to walk from the doctor’s office to the pharmacy. This is made possible with the Outpatient Pharmacy Automation System (OPAS) which integrates automated dispensing machines and scanning devices into the medication workflow to manage tasks such as the picking, packing, labelling, assembling, verifying and dispensing of medication.  With the system automating 80 per cent of the medication dispensing workflow, it also helped to improve staff productivity by doing away with the rework and reducing the number of calls they make to clarify prescriptions. NCS is currently exploring with healthcare and eldercare providers in Singapore to make use of teleconsultation tools to allow one-to-one interactions between patients and doctors.  “We are also looking at deploying autonomous vehicles that are powered by AI algorithms for use in enclosed healthcare campuses for delivery of drugs and diagnostic tools. Additionally, we are seeking opportunities to work closely with life sciences and pharma industry to see how we can use our AI capabilities to help with reducing clinical/pharma trials,” said Jim.  Another concept that NCS is looking to explore is the creation of AI-assisted robotic nursing assistants, which support nurses in carrying out tasks such as measuring a patient’s vital signs, delivering and dispensing medication as well as delivering items to patients autonomously. These robotic assistants, also known as Florence, generates up to 20% freed-up time for nurses to focus on patient engagement, according to early stage trials by NCS.  Currently, NCS is also embarking on a pilot project with healthcare providers on the use of AI algorithms to assist patients to make decisions on the various healthcare financing schemes available during their hospital stay, which can help reduce complexity and create a seamless experience for patients.    To learn more about NCS' healthcare solutions, click  .

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  Delivering the right medication, in the right dose, to the right patient, at the right time – these are the essential 4 “rights” (4Rs) in administering medication. And NCS has been working with hospitals in Singapore to achieve this through a Closed Loop Medication Management System (CLMMS) which incorporates the Electronic Inpatient Medication Record System (eIMR) developed by NCS. CLMMS is a revolutionary process that leverages automation and intelligent systems to improve the entire medication administration process from the way doctors prescribe medication to how each dose of medicine is consumed by patients. This enables hospitals to significantly improve patient safety and the efficiency of healthcare staff even as patient volumes grow. eIMR is a key component of CLMMS, enabling doctors to order medication electronically and pharmacists to review the prescriptions and provide interventions, if required, before the medication is served by nurses to patients in the wards. We have also built interfaces between eIMR and the automated dispensing machines and hand-held scanning devices in the hospital to enable a closed-loop approach to ordering, dispensing and administering medication in the course of patient care. Implemented across National University Hospital, Tan Tock Seng Hospital and Institute of Mental Health, the system helps enhance patient safety through the 4Rs. It enables early detection of risky medication regimes which could cause overdosing, allergic reactions in patient or result in cross-drug interactions, and allows for timely intervention by pharmacists to prevent medication errors.   This article was first published in NCS SG50 Book “Technology Evolution”, 2015 (NLB BRN:201353230) Share this article on: Discover how you can chart your career and elevate your skills.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  Tracking bodies is a grim undertaking, but it is something that FIONA has been able to carry out efficiently while achieving a paperless breakthrough in forensics operations. FIONA or Forensic Integrated Operations Network Applications is an IT initiative by the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) to streamline the administrative processes and workflow associated with forensic medical services. HSA’s goal was to reduce the manpower required for data entry, improve data flow within the Forensic Medicine Division and better coordinate with external agencies such as the police for case registration. It was also looking for a way to improve the tracking and management of bodies and related document flows. To address these requirements, NCS integrated a suite of technologies to create a wireless, paperless environment for the Forensic Medicine Division. An Integrated Track and Trace framework was implemented using RFID technology to track the movement of bodies and specimens. Clinical mobile notebooks were also introduced for body charting and note-taking in the autopsy suite while the pathologist was performing the autopsy. This allows the data to be synchronised with HSA’s servers, removing the need for manual data entry. Documents such as post-mortem reports can also be generated directly through FIONA. FIONA proved to be a breakthrough for HSA. The adoption of RFID technology greatly increased efficiency in the management of body parts within the forensic setting. The cost and effort associated with manual data entry was significantly reduced with the use of technologies for data capture and updates. Furthermore, with more streamlined workflows, inter-agency interaction such as the exchange of data between the police and HSA can now take place electronically, allowing cases to be processed much more rapidly.    This article was first published in NCS SG50 Book “Technology Evolution”, 2015 (NLB BRN:201353230) Share this article on: Discover how you can chart your career and elevate your skills.

How big data is shaping the future of healthcare? | NCS SG how big data is shaping the future of healthcare? Contact Us Thank you for your interest. Introduction Healthcare and the Internet of Things Taking healthcare to the next level with big data and AI The need for data governance Adapting to the rapid rate of change Conclusion more on exponential tech explore the rest of the Future Trends 
                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  A mere two years after the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, the healthcare community developed effective vaccines, therapies, and diagnostic tools for tackling the SARS-CoV-2 virus, things that would have taken significantly longer, perhaps even decades, prior to the pandemic. This was partly achieved by using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to analyse large datasets. Pfizer said that “process and technology optimisations, including a new machine learning tool known as Smart Data Query (SDQ)” helped speed up . Meanwhile, Najat Khan, Chief Data Science Officer and Global Head of Strategy and Operations for , the developers of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, said that “Data science and machine learning can be used to augment scientific understanding of a disease. For Covid-19, these tools became even more important because our knowledge was rather limited. There was no hypothesis at the time. We were developing an unbiased understanding of the disease based on real-world data using sophisticated AI/ML algorithms.” This is part of a wider trend towards digitalisation in the healthcare sector. By digitalising processes and harnessing the power of data, today’s healthcare institutions are building resilience and agility and driving innovation. This data-driven approach is timely. With urban populations expanding fast and many healthcare institutions grappling with staff shortages, healthcare leaders need to fundamentally rethink how care is delivered. This includes taking into account the following questions: To address these questions, healthcare leaders need to understand the importance of big data and how it is enabling new health ecosystems that better meet the changing needs of clinicians, medical researchers, and patients. They need to be able to process large datasets and derive useful and timely insights from them through the use of AI-powered analytics. This will help them understand patients better, solve complex problems, and improve decision making. An example of how this works in practice is the , a smart scheduling solution which NCS is developing in partnership with the Singapore National Eye Centre (SNEC). The first solution of its kind in Singapore, the ASO will transform clinic operations, reduce patient waiting times, and allocate manpower and resources more efficiently. It uses NCS NEXT’s capabilities in AI, advanced analytics, and ML technology as well as SNEC’s patient and operational data to perform optimal supply-demand matching, thus ensuring patient appointments are matched optimally with available clinical resources. This begs an important question: where is all this valuable data coming from? There is a wide array of sources, including patient records, lab results, scientific literature, social media, and more. However, it is the Internet of Things (IoT) that is arguably enabling the greatest possibilities in the area of data-driven healthcare services. Things like wearable devices and implantable transceivers deliver real-time or near-real-time health updates which healthcare institutions can use to provide “telemedicine” solutions. These solutions allow healthcare practitioners to monitor patients’ conditions, give consultations, and issue prescriptions remotely. They not only make it easier for people to seek treatment for illnesses, they also allow them to more easily maintain good health.  The global IoT medical devices market is growing fast. According to MarketsandMarkets, it was worth   and is projected to be worth USD94.2 billion by 2026. Consumer tech companies like Amazon, Apple, and Fitbit are increasingly getting in on the action. Deloitte Global says that   are expected to ship worldwide this year and that figure will likely hit 440 million units by 2024 as new offerings enter the market and healthcare providers become more comfortable with using them.  As the market expands, connected medical and wellness devices are growing more advanced. The Apple Watch, for example, can monitor the wearer’s blood oxygen levels and take electrocardiogram readings and, according to  , future models will include features like body temperature and blood sugar sensors. If healthcare providers are able to properly capture and process the wealth of data generated from IoT medical devices, they will be able to understand their patients better and thus offer more accurate diagnoses and improve treatment outcomes. Harnessing AI is now top of the agenda for decision makers, investors, administrators, and innovators in the healthcare sector. The United States currently leads the way, with more completed AI-related healthcare research studies and trials than any other country as of 2020, according to a   jointly released by EIT Health and McKinsey. However, “the fastest growth is emerging in Asia, especially China, where leading domestic conglomerates and tech players have consumer-focused healthcare AI offerings and Ping An’s Good Doctor, the leading online health-management platform, already lists more than 300 million users,” the report notes. This increasing emphasis on AI goes hand in hand with an explosion in the amount of health data that is available through IoT devices. Moreover, more regulators around the world are now requiring healthcare providers to maintain a longitudinal health record for each patient comprised of data generated from all the patient’s interactions with the healthcare system. Singapore, for example, has created a central repository for healthcare data sourced from various institutions and players in the healthcare ecosystem. With this data at their fingertips, authorised providers are able to make faster, more accurate diagnoses and deliver personalised long-term care plans for patients. This is helpful in supporting initiatives such as the   in Singapore, which aims to shift the focus of Singapore’s healthcare system from treating illnesses to keeping people healthy and thus, as far as possible, preventing them from getting sick in the first place.  Big data and advanced analytics capabilities have proved to be crucial in efforts to curb the spread of Covid-19. As part of Singapore’s Covid-19 contact tracing efforts, NCS created a digital solution called   which collects health status and contact tracing data through crowdsourcing, and uses relevant data to help organisations easily stay informed about the latest health status and movement of unwell employees. With this solution, a business can perform organisation-wide risk monitoring, place staff on quarantine if need be, and tackle the spread of the coronavirus within its own workforce. Powered by cloud technology and advanced analytics, NCS OneShield allows users to determine which teams have the highest number of staff on medical leave, and if containment of that business unit needs to take place. A real-time analytics dashboard also makes it easy to spot and predict trends in staff behaviour so that a predictive disease response plan can be quickly initiated to prevent infections across the workplace. As healthcare institutions leverage increasingly large and complex datasets, it is vital that they ensure that the data is up to date, accurate, complete, and free of bias. Failure to do so will have an adverse effect on decision making. As Goh Han Leong, Principal Specialist, Data Analytics & AI, IHiS said in an  , “Poor data quality or understanding of the data collected will result in a garbage-data-in and garbage-insights-out situation. To respond to the data opportunities, we should also invest in building a trusted shared platform that has good data provenance and lineage.” The  (AIHGle) published by Singapore’s Ministry of Health (MOH) last year note that AI “amplifies existing process and data risks, and creates new accountability and algorithmic risks which, if not managed systematically, may lead to poor patient outcomes and erode clinician and patients’ trust in the use of AI – limiting the potential benefits of the technology.” The intent behind the AIHGIe is to “improve the understanding, codify good practice, and support the safe growth of AI in healthcare.” The guidelines are underpinned by the understanding that AI should be deployed with fairness, responsibility, transparency, explainability, and patient-centricity. In addition to ensuring that the quality of their data is good, healthcare institutions need to take steps to protect the privacy of patients. This means putting in place strong cyber-security and data protection measures. As the AIHGIe points out, data protection includes things like anonymising data and applying privacy-enhancing technologies such as homomorphic encryption during data analysis and modelling. As cutting-edge technologies and advanced capabilities like AI-powered data analytics become more widespread in the healthcare sector, it is important to ensure that all staff are kept up to date with the latest developments. According to a  , “clinicians identify education and training on the latest technical developments as a key priority for the next 10 years.”  Healthcare organisations will need to foster a culture which supports the use of digital technologies, with leaders communicating the need for such technologies to all levels of their organisation. Moreover, they should ensure that digital solutions are implemented with flexibility and scalability in mind to ensure that they remain effective over the long term. From aiding drug research and development to streamlining appointment scheduling, there are numerous ways data and AI can improve the healthcare sector. Advanced data analytics is making it possible for healthcare institutions to provide more personalised care, thereby allowing them to shift their focus from treating illnesses to helping individuals maintain good health. While these developments are welcome, healthcare leaders must make sure they keep patients front and centre in their digital transformation strategies. As Lim says, “It’s an exciting time for healthcare technology and the possibilities that lie ahead will have many leaders racing to make things happen. But it’s important to always keep care and the patients at the very heart of any innovation and development.” Share this article on: Thank you for your enquiry!

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  Healthcare workers around the world are chronically overworked. Nurses, for instance, often work long shifts and are expected to carry out a plethora of tasks, from dispensing medication to monitoring vital signs to keeping medical records up to date to assisting with medical procedures, and much more. The Covid-19 pandemic has put these workers under even greater strain, with many working even longer hours than usual while putting themselves at considerable risk of infection. A July 2021   conducted by the Institute of Mental Health found that Singaporean GPs were experiencing higher levels of anxiety, burnout, and depression than before the pandemic. A similar situation in the United States has led to   considering leaving direct patient care, according to a study conducted by McKinsey. Things are only likely to get more challenging for the healthcare sector. The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that the world will see a shortfall of  . While this shortfall will disproportionately affect low- and middle-income countries, all countries will to some extent face “difficulties in the education, employment, deployment, retention, and performance of their workforce,” the organisation says. However, thanks to great strides made in the field of robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) in recent years, robots are increasingly being deployed in the healthcare sector to help relieve the burden on human workers. Indeed, robots are doing things like dispensing medication, disinfecting wards, carrying supplies or equipment, updating records, keeping patients company, and even assisting in surgical procedures. While there is understandable concern from some parties about machines replacing humans in the workforce, it is clear that there are practical and emotional gains for healthcare workers with robots working alongside them in a supporting capacity.     Robots are transforming the nursing profession. One of the greatest benefits they provide is the ability to handle repetitive, laborious, and time-consuming tasks. NCS is currently conducting trials of a robotic nursing assistant called  with  Singapore Public Hospitals. Florence is able to perform a range of tasks, including measuring patients’ vital signs, synchronising patients’ data for real-time follow-up, and delivering medicines and snacks. Florence can independently navigate to the patient bedside in busy wards and interact with patients and staff via speech or through the built-in touchscreen. Robotic nursing assistants like Florence will become very valuable in healthcare institutions in the near future as robots can work longer shifts without needing sleep or food, treat all patients equitably, and can safely attend to patients infected with contagious diseases without risk of infection. Moreover, NCS can deploy its Robot Health Manager to perform remote surveillance to detect unwell persons using audio and video analytics (for quick isolation or attention). The self-navigating robot identifies Persons of Interest (POI), provides contactless monitoring of vital signs including temperature and heart rate, and uses sound and gesture sensors to detect coughing. In essence, robots enable healthcare professionals to apply themselves more fully to their main role — providing care. By taking on menial jobs like cleaning, record keeping, monitoring vitals, and distributing medicines, robots free up healthcare workers’ time and energy for the aspects of care that require a human touch. Jim Lim, Healthcare Sector Lead at NCS commented that during the trial of Florence, preliminary findings indicated a 17 percent increase in nursing productivity.   It is inevitable that robotics will play an increasing role in healthcare over the coming years. Robots and automation solutions should be deployed to tasks that are best suited to their capabilities — for example, carrying out monotonous or physically demanding tasks — while leaving the healthcare workforce to concentrate on the “human touch” aspect of healthcare services. In particular, healthcare providers should consider using robots for the following use cases:   The Singaporean government wants to make the country a “living laboratory” for the development of AI solutions. In an interview for GovInsider, Dr Goh Han Leong, Principal Specialist, Data Analytics & AI, IHiS, points out that  to make this vision a reality thanks to a good regulatory landscape, healthy synergy between various government bodies, and a highly tech-savvy population. To successfully incorporate robotics and intelligent technologies in the healthcare system, it is important that private and public stakeholders, including tech developers, medical experts, and policymakers, collaborate toward achieving the common goal of sustainable, value-driven healthcare. Joo Cheng Lim, Director Product Engineering at NCS, says that “Robotics in patient care will very likely revolutionise the way we deliver care. We must be innovative and proactively involved in charting the path into what skills robots provide, and how robots are incorporated into the patient care ecosystem.” Jim agrees that robotics will have a positive impact on healthcare. “With wider deployment of 5G technology, robotics and AI will be contributing more use cases in healthcare, such as robot-assisted surgery,” he says. “We believe that robotics will be able to help in treating more patients and addressing the talent crunch situation. Definitely more treat than threat for healthcare professionals.”   NCS SG, Principal Product Engineer, Products & Platforms Share this article on: Thank you for your enquiry!

                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  Population ageing and urbanisation are two of the most significant demographic trends being observed in societies around the world today. Both of these trends have major implications for many areas of life, not least how we look at retirement. In 2018 the number of people aged 64 years and above surpassed the number of children under five years old for the first time in history, according to . Meanwhile, the United States’ National Institute on Ageing expects that the global population of people aged 80 and older will  from 126.5 million to 446.6 million between 2015 and 2050. In some Asian and Latin American countries, this cohort is expected to quadruple in size during the same period. With more people living longer lives and fewer people entering the labour market, retirement savings and old-age pension systems are coming under significant strain. Poor economic conditions exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic have made the situation worse, according to a  from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Challenges brought about by population ageing extend beyond the economic sphere. Hence, there is a growing focus on population health so as to address healthcare needs as well as the Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) that are barriers to equity of health access. Various aspects under consideration are a greater emphasis on preventive health, a fundamental rethink of the use of urban spaces and infrastructure, and the active role that seniors can play in society.   In line with this, Singapore’s Ministry of Health (MOH) unveiled the “Healthier.SG” initiative this year. The initiative is intended to arrest rapidly increasing government healthcare expenditure (forecasted to triple to SGD 27 billion in 2030) and the increased utilisation of healthcare services brought about by the deteriorating health of Singaporeans due to ageing and the adoption of less healthy lifestyles (e.g., the number of Singaporeans who suffer from high blood pressure is up to 3 in 10 in 2020 from 2 in 10 in 2017).   This initiative comprises three main components: Additionally, MOH has adopted an inclusive and holistic approach to ensure that our seniors are well cared for and as active as possible throughout their retirement years.   MOH promotes a Senior Care Centre Service Model where seniors can receive active ageing, befriending, and referral-to-care services. This also benefits seniors who live independently as it allows them to receive continuous support to engage in physical (e.g. exercise) and virtual activities, widen their social circles, and stay physically well and mentally alert to stave off physical frailty and the onset of dementia. Befriending is an essential activity to keep seniors engaged, especially those living alone. Many seniors want to contribute meaningfully to society through learning, volunteerism, and continued employment. These activities allow seniors to interact with younger Singaporeans and impart their life experiences, skills, and values, thereby building inter-generational bonds. Urban spaces are generally not senior-friendly. A recent paper entitled  points out that societies tend to segregate seniors in residential care units, retirement villages, and nursing homes. This restricts their interactions with society at large and is detrimental to their overall well-being. Inclusive age-friendly cities built around the concepts of “ageing-in-place” and “active ageing”1 run counter to this. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines active ageing as “the process of optimising opportunities for health, participation, and security in order to enhance quality of life as people age”. An age-friendly city benefits everyone and treats seniors as active, valued participants in their communities and the economy. MOH has put in place measures to support seniors to age-in-place by increasing access to diverse home and community-based care options within an inclusive environment.  A Community Care apartment pilot i.e. an integrated housing-cum-care model centred around public housing units integrated with adjoining facilities such as a primary care polyclinic, a supermarket, a community centre, and a food centre integrated within the same estate, saw strong demand. There is great potential to expand this to the private sector and also to offer more innovative assisted living models.   Rethinking old age in the context of an increasingly technology-saturated world has led to the rise of gerontechnology, an interdisciplinary field focused on using advances in technology to maximise the independence of seniors and promote the overall well-being and quality of life of these individuals as well as that of their families and caregivers.  Gerontechnology addresses challenges associated with old age, including functional declines, loneliness, depression, cognitive impairment, and social isolation, among others. Telehealth, one branch of gerontechnology, has proven benefits in senior care. CareLine, for example, is a 24/7 personal care telephone service that provides tele-befriending and emergency response services to seniors who are living alone or are frail, thereby helping these seniors to keep safe at home. Call agents are trained to converse in the vernacular. Supporting 17,000 vulnerable seniors, CareLine receives 30 calls a month from seniors requiring emergency services. To right-site care, call agents are trained to triage seniors’ conditions after a distress episode and provide remote assistance or activate non-urgent in-person assistance through nearby community providers. NCS sees a potential for this service to be scaled to cater to the needs of more tech-savvy seniors through an app that features a befriending chat service that also incorporates an AI-based symptom checker to help triage seniors’ conditions and provide remote assistance or activate non-urgent in-person assistance through nearby community providers. Going one step further, this app could be linked to smart sensors installed in the seniors’ homes that monitor their behaviour and activity routine so as to automatically detect and activate assistance should deviations be detected. This is a realistic aim given the Housing & Development Board’s (HDB) Smart-Enabled Home initiative which aims to improve daily living in HDB homes through the use of commercial smart home devices. Tele-health, in other forms, continues to evolve, offering an ever-increasing range of services from virtual consultations to prescription drug refill authorisations to remote care services that include remote diagnostics and health monitoring. Assistive technology, on the other hand, can help seniors with reduced mobility, visual and hearing impairments, dementia, and other conditions that undermine their independence. Examples include screen reading software which converts text-to-speech or braille, screen magnification software, amplified telephone equipment, memory aids, and personal emergency response systems which automatically alert caregivers when a senior is in danger.   “Singapore’s healthcare institutions, especially those in public healthcare, are already at a certain level of maturity of technological advancement compared to most countries,” says Jim Lim, Healthcare Sector Lead at NCS. Moving forward, there are many opportunities to digitalise the long-term and senior care sectors with new technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, and 5G to support more integrated care and the realisation of an age-friendly society. NCS is working to innovate solutions to support “ageing-in-place” and senior independent living to enhance the quality of life of seniors. For example, a cloud-based senior independent monitoring solution called CARECONNECT was piloted by NCS Australia. NCS’s emphasis on senior safety led us to develop a   solution which uses state-of-the-art video analytics, 5G, and deep learning algorithms to anticipate and prevent seniors from falling. The solution is currently being piloted in a senior care institution in Singapore. Moreover, NCS’s strong focus on robotics has led to the development of a robotic nursing assistant, aptly called Florence, to provide assistance to ward nurses through patient bedside interactions and vital signs measurement. Other robotic solutions offered by NCS support operations like item delivery and tele-presence solutions such as video consultations and engagement and interaction with seniors. There is still much to be done to build an age-friendly society that allows people of all ages to flourish. Strategic planning coupled with the application of suitable technologies in the correct context and at the right price, will ensure we meet the evolving needs of an ageing population in a sensible and sustainable manner.    Global Age-Friendly Cities: A Guide, World Health Organization (2007), https://www.who.int/ageing/publications/Global_age_friendly_cities_Guide_English.pdf NCS SG, Director, Incubation Products & Platforms Share this article on: Thank you for your enquiry!

                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  Trends Impacting the Future of Work Globalisation and new technologies have in recent years wrought profound changes in the way we work. These changes have become more pronounced in light of the Covid-19 pandemic, which disrupted labour markets and forced organisations around the globe to adopt remote or hybrid working models. As a result, organisations are increasingly thinking about what the future of work will look like. Gerard Koh, Vice President People and Culture at NCS Group, says that there are three key trends to watch: Today’s rapid rate of technological change is causing lines between industries to become increasingly blurred. Organisations in the property, finance, and fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) spaces are adopting more IT-based business models. As Koh says, “every company today wants to become a tech company.”  In the healthcare sector, tasks like screening, monitoring, and diagnostics can be handled by applications, freeing up doctors’ time to focus more on patient care. The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) will cause some industries and jobs to disappear altogether. Automation technologies are becoming ubiquitous in the workplace. However, a recent  conducted by Bain & Company and UiPath uncovered an interesting paradox: while 86 percent of employees want to use automation, only 30 percent of business leaders give them access to it, and only 5 percent allow them to create their own automations. Despite fears about robots replacing humans in the workplace, automation is actually creating new jobs. This is because innovative technologies create new needs and alter existing ones. The jobs least at risk of being taken over by AI and robotic process automation (RPA) are those that are creative in nature or involve empathy or the ability to organise and lead teams. Global talent mobility is at an all-time high. Workers, especially highly skilled ones, have been moving around the world in ever-increasing numbers for many years now, thanks to globalisation and technologies and business models that allow for hyperconnectivity and hyper-collaboration. The rise of remote working during the pandemic has only served to accelerate this trend. This has major implications for the way organisations operate. For example, managing a global workforce means keeping on top of labour and tax laws in multiple jurisdictions. Increased talent mobility also means that employers need to focus more on how to attract and retain talent. This is especially pertinent given the fact that workers, especially those in the  , have been leaving or switching jobs in record numbers in recent months, a trend known as the Great Resignation.   Amid these developments, the IT department is undergoing a sea change. In most organisations, the size of the IT department has decreased from hundreds of employees to less than 10 in line with a reduced focus on IT infrastructure. IT departments have traditionally been responsible for deploying and    that enables employees to collaborate seamlessly and securely within their organisation and with external partners. This includes things like computers, servers, software, Internet connection, and so on.  → However, with the rise of cloud computing, many organisations are simplifying their IT operations by switching to a consumption-based model. This allows organisations to cut costs by paying only for the IT services that they need, while improving efficiency by reducing or eliminating dependence on complex legacy systems. It also allows organisations to stay up to date with the latest IT innovations without having the expense of regularly upgrading on-premises systems. “I think infrastructure will become like how you consume power,” Albert Koh, Senior Partner, Infrastructure (Enterprise) at NCS Group, says, “if it works, nobody complains. Everything is done by the service provider.” According to Koh, “if you look at the future of IT departments, there’s not going to be space for infrastructure teams. You should not be managing infrastructure; you should be managing your business — looking at the goals. The new companies — the fintech, the start-up — I really do not believe they have a tech infrastructure back there. It’s kind of minimal.” The shift to a consumption-based model means that the role of the IT department has changed. Whereas IT teams largely operated behind the scenes in the past, today they are much more involved in the strategy side of things and helping their organisations harness the power of data to drive growth. According to a  conducted by Gartner, “84 percent of CIOs at top-performing organisations have responsibility for areas of the business outside of traditional IT, the most common being innovation and transformation.” The IT department will play an increasingly pivotal role as ever more advanced technologies continue to transform the workplace. This will necessitate a radical change in the way organisations view the IT function, and it will require IT teams to develop new skill sets. According to Koh, companies in the Asia-Pacific region have some catching up to do in this regard. “The thing in the US is that they are more ready to fail than we are. Here, if something is working then why do I want to change?” he says. If companies are risk averse, then there is a need to push the boundaries. Transformation does not have a finishing line, it is a journey. Companies that stay proactive will eventually come up ahead. As demand for service-based IT products continues to increase, so, too, will consumption-based options, which could revolutionize the IT departments as we know it. The true value from tech can be harnessed from advanced technology that allows you to innovate instead of simply reacting to industry changes.  By planning ahead, you can target untapped markets with expanding your customer base.

                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  With 500 million tweets, 65 billion messages sent on WhatsApp, and 4 terabytes of data created from Facebook, it’s estimated that by 2025, 463 exabytes of data will be created each day globally, which is the equivalent of 212,765,957 DVDs per day, according to statistics published by   in 2019. With this vast amount of data coming in increasing volumes and at a higher velocity, do we truly know its intrinsic value? And what could this look like as we enter an even more data-driven future?    Since data is the fuel of machine learning and AI technology, businesses need to ensure that the quality of data is up to the mark.   But having said that, many companies are still defaulting to a keep-everything mindset, archiving everything about their operations and customers in the hope that the data may become valuable someday. Log files and transaction records that could have been deleted are retained indefinitely, resulting in a landfill of data that ends up being irrelevant, messy, and costly.   Poor quality data — that is, data that is inaccurate, incomplete, or out of date — is a substantial issue for any organisation. Among other things, it can cause an organisation to make wrong decisions or fail to deliver its services properly and ultimately, affect the bottom line. According to a Gartner article released last year, poor data quality costs organisations   every year.  It may seem like storing data is becoming cheaper, thanks to advances in storage technologies. However, storing data goes beyond the servers and hardware. One will need system administrators, database administrators, and other data professionals to organise the data in a safe and secure manner. If a company does not have proper data security measures, having more data will only exponentially increase the risk of a data security breach.  Having more data also means greater efforts are needed to ensure the data is properly quality-checked and organised for access and use by the business. There is no point having all the data when it is not understandable, easily accessible, or trusted by the users.  Then, there is also an environmental cost. As we see how much energy our data centres are consuming all the time, and how much electronic waste we are producing, the exponential growth in data does not necessarily bode well for our planet.    According to Gartner analyst Nick Heudecker, the   stands at an astounding 85%. Success rates can be significantly improved if companies at the onset of their big data projects or transformation address two main questions: Only by being clear about what tangible business outcomes are to be achieved with data, will the company be able to:   As companies increasingly turn to AI to build a competitive advantage, the importance of collecting and managing data will only increase. AI systems learn through data, and the accuracies of AI models depend heavily on the availability and quality of data.    NCS has helped many of its enterprise clients put in place data lakes and extract, transform, and load (ETL) pipelines as well as analytic tools and techniques with which to manage and use their collected data effectively. In the emerging AI era, NCS is increasingly involved in data-intensive projects. Our work in this area ranges from training AI models with proper data sets, to ensuring that the data captured by the AI model is used in a completely fair and ethical manner that does not discriminate in terms of race, ethnicity, or gender.   For more complex business decisions, NCS leverages machine learning and historical data to aid in decision making. For instance, in cyber security and financial transactions where there are millions of events a day, unsupervised machine learning techniques are used to detect anomalous activities that could indicate a cyber-attack or fraud.  According to Royston Bok, the Director of AI Initiatives at NCS Group, AI has taken some of the pressure off decision making. In particular, it can help with the following:  He also believes that AI is not just data-driven but also business-centric. Enterprises should work with AI service partners that are able to plan out the AI transformation roadmap with clients while keeping in mind the business values.   Essentially, platforms, people, and processes must be looked at holistically to succeed in the AI transformation journey.  Ravi Bedi, Head & Practice Lead, AI-Led Solutions, NEXT Solutions at NCS, outlined some of the key ways data is being used in different industries to create value and drive growth in times of uncertainty. He highlighted the following examples:       By storing and making accessible certain persistent data features and attributes, some companies have been able to unlock significant value in their digital transformation journeys and enable innovation at-scale.  There is a wide range of tools out there to help companies organise and harness the power of their data, once there is clarity about the relevant use cases and data attributes.  C3 AI and NCS have established a Center of Excellence together to jointly explore new solutions that will accelerate the adoption of enterprise AI and develop custom-built offerings tailored to the business requirements of the Asia-Pacific market.  AI models at-scale will be key to building the next generation of digital applications with enterprise AI embedded. A model-driven architecture fully addresses the requirements for the digital transformation software stack, providing a low-code/no-code AI and Internet of Things (IoT) platform that accelerates software development by a factor of 26 or more, reduces costs and risk, and delivers future-proof applications.  Data and AI go hand in hand. With quality data, AI is able to learn and provide better outcomes that in turn reap more meaningful returns. Data quality is indeed a pre-condition for AI. Poor data quality leads to analytics and AI projects taking longer than expected which could lead to losses in revenue, resources, and reputation. Companies, regardless of sectors, ultimately have to be clear about what tangible business outcomes they would like to achieve. Only then can they build the right strategies, infrastructure, and processes to harness the power of data.  NCS SG, Senior Partner and Chief Scientist NCS SG, Head & Practice Lead, Al-Led Solutions, NEXT Solutions NCS SG, Director, AI Initiatives Share this article on: Thank you for your enquiry!

                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  What does the future hold?  It’s a difficult question to answer and one that raises many questions of its own. Will there be flying cars? Can humans move towards living forever? These are just some of big and sometimes scary, questions posed about humanity’s next chapter. Whilst we don’t have all the answers for how to face the challenges of the next 10+ years today, when we ask the right questions and partner with the right people, anything is possible. Because behind any of development or innovation that could come along, there are bigger forces at work. Forces that dictate the ‘why’ of future change, and it’s by identifying and exploring these forces that we can best prepare ourselves for the next wave of technological change, disruption, and possibilities. As a trusted innovation partner to governments and enterprises, we have a responsibility to help see into the future and inform organisations’ next moves. As part of our Future Trends series, we’ll be doing exactly that. We’ve identified five forces shaping everything we know about the future and what it means for industries, communities, and our planet.   One future trend that is sure to impact every aspect of our lives is our growing population. The United Nations forecasts that by 2040, there will be 2 billion1 more people on the planet, and by 2030 more than 70% of the total population will live in cities. This ever-growing population will increasingly strain and test resources, whether it’s energy and housing or spaces in schools and hospitals, smart strategies are needed to ensure demand doesn’t overtake or disrupt supply. These densely populated cities of the future will need next-level infrastructure and have the room for such accelerating growth designed into them. How can technology help us overcome these challenges and build smarter infrastructure ready for future populations? Asking more of the right questions today, will help us deal with how this affects key areas like housing, transport, and security, and where technologies like digital twin and advanced analytics can come in to lay the foundations and transform the landscape of our future communities.   Our financial systems are no strangers to rapid innovation, in less than a lifetime, many of us have seen a switch from entirely cash-based economies to one that is largely cashless and now even contactless, where payments are made and processed across borders and infrastructures in milliseconds. So, what is next for our economies? With the emergence and proliferation of blockchain technology, we’re seeing new possibilities opening and new systems taking shape. The next wave of globalised finance will depend on infrastructure capable of rapidly processing unprecedented amounts of transactions, but also increasingly sophisticated cyber security to protect against ever-more sophisticated threats. We’ll be looking at what these changes mean for financial institutions, other enterprises, and our communities.   It’s said that the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the development and deployment of technology across every aspect of our lives, and this is certainly true for healthcare. The global crisis caused by COVID-19 has showcased how advanced and incredible our healthcare systems and innovations have become. The speed at which we were able to adapt and create systems to track the movement of the virus and to deploy technologies that eliminate the need for human interaction, which the pandemic had made impossible, was a clear testament to our progress. Technology will continue to reshape healthcare as we know it. We’re already seeing robot nurses being trialed and prepared to augment the care offered by doctors in hospital. And technologies like 5G will unlock whole new possibilities like remote robotic surgery. And behind the scenes, data analytics will be working away to make care better informed and to better predict healthcare outcomes for all. We’ll be diving deeper into these vital signs of what’s to come in our coming content.   It’s impossible to discuss the factors and forces that will shape our future without discussing environmental concerns. Climate change and the scarcity of resources is going to heavily impact every single one of us. And the effects of these need to be factored into decision making and need to drive innovations that help us protect the planet, use resources efficiently and adapt to the ever-changing situation. The world is likely to increase its energy consumption by 30% between now and the year 20404. So how will we ensure resources are used efficiently and that communities can fuel progress into the future, without creating a negative impact for our planet and environment? We’ll be exploring these challenges and speaking to experts in the field.   As these forces shape our world, there is one thing that will underpin all the strategies to adapt: rapid technological advancement. The great leaps forward we’ve already seen are only the beginning and within 10 years, technology as we know it today will be virtually unrecognisable. We know that Cloud, 5G and AI, are only the beginning, as our lives become increasingly integrated with the data and intelligence around us, what we define as ‘technology’ will be redefined and the potential of it will change entirely. We’ll be looking at the new ways this ever-advancing technology can play a part in transforming industries and advancing our communities. And technology has a vital role to play. It is, in some ways, the ‘ace up the sleeve’ for our future’s, communities, and planet. Working together to harness technology is how we’ll answer the questions posed and challenges raised by these future trends. One thing is clear, in order to overcome the challenges ahead and grasp the opportunities, collaboration is the magic ingredient that will drive real progress and ensure we can all succeed and thrive together.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  With the standard support of SAP ERP Central Component (ECC) systems ending in 2027, there is a need for existing SAP users to reoptimise their SAP core products for SAP HANA database. SAP users will have to migrate their existing SAP systems to one that meets the hardware requirements of running SAP S/4HANA. NCS can help enterprises migrate their existing SAP workloads to a Cloud platform as part of the SAP upgrading and rehosting support which provides efficiency, scalability, resiliency, agility and cost savings. AWS CloudEndure provides a simplified and automated lift and shift migration solution that can support SAP workloads such as SAP S/4HANA. This migration solution will greatly reduce the operational cost throughout the infrastructure migration process as it only requires temporary AWS staging servers. Once the SAP workloads are migrated to AWS infrastructure, the upgrade to S/4HANA will proceed to take place. The migration of source SAP servers is a continuous block-level data replication to AWS staging servers that does not disrupt business operations. Once the enterprise is ready to perform a production cut-over, AWS CloudEndure will convert the on-premise to AWS infrastructure with a very minimal business downtime. AWS CloudEndure supports the migration of SAP workloads running on physical, virtual or any other Cloud-based infrastructure. As an AWS platinum partner, NCS is well-positioned to help enterprises migrate and transition smoothly from SAP ECC to SAP S/4HANA with AWS CloudEndure.

Without mutual context, those practices form a culture that hinders collaboration between teams. Additional shortcomings of traditional software development practices include extended configuration duration of infrastructure, laborious deployment process, and inconsistent application behaviour between environments. All these lead to inefficiencies which slow speed to market. DevSecOps offers an alternative approach to software development by integrating the once-distinct scopes of development, security and operations, promoting continuous feedback and continuous improvements. At its core, DevSecOps shifts culture and outdated practices to improve the application development process. DevSecOps within NCS is a culture and a philosophy that is founded upon the following five cornerstones:   CODESparks is an integrated DevSecOps platform that combines DevSecOps products and industry best practices. It centralises the governance of projects, tools and infrastructure, represents data into a single consolidated dashboard, and enhances integration between DevSecOps tools. With CODESparks, teams adopting Agile and DevSecOps best practices have a platform to support them throughout the delivery process, enabling better performance. NCS DevSecOps practice provides proven solution that covers on-premise and cloud deployments. We have successfully implemented many projects to accelerate organisation’s cloud adoption journey on AWS. We bring fundamental cultural changes in the way we collaborate and develop solutions to create business value.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  The desired state for organisations is to have the ability to do continuous delivery with speed and application stability. This has led them to adopting DevOps – a set of practices that integrate development and operations to promote collaboration between previously isolated teams. DevOps incorporates a continuous feedback mechanism that allows ongoing improvement aided by automation. Security has also been included into the framework, leading to the term DevSecOps which encompasses speed, quality and security in application development To ensure that environments can be easily managed and automated, we advocate approaching DevOps with as-a-code mindset, which focuses on continuous integration and infrastructure management. This makes all components more maintainable and facilitates a means to govern the deployment of infrastructure. In the case of continuous integration/continuous development (CI/CD) for example, the “as code” mindset helps to ensure that development pipelines can be easily defined, tracked and changed. For instance, with Jenkins pipeline implementations using Jenkinsfile, approval mechanisms can be set in place and managed by the development teams as they would for any other code. This helps with change control and audit. Change history can be traced and when configurations go wrong, developers would have a way to rollback easily to previous configurations, without the need to keep backing up the entire Jenkins job configuration. With infrastructure as code, teams will be able to replace entire environments with the assurance that all configurations would be consistent. For example, in cloud-based environments, scripts can be used to define everything from virtual machines to firewall rules and network layout, and provide the assurance that each component will have the same configuration every time the script runs. Approaching DevSecOps with an “as code” mindset ensures that application development environments can be easily managed and automated. It makes all components more maintainable and provides a way for entire infrastructure models to be governed. The “as code” approach can also be applied to the setup of workstations. System and software engineers developing applications and maintaining infrastructures face an ongoing challenge in setting up complex workstations to help them do their job. A new member who just joined the development team is usually given documentation with instructions on how he can set up his machine. This often involves installing different toolsets, integrated development environments (IDEs) and setting up environment variables – tasks that will probably require assistance from his colleagues and take a full day to complete. The same laborious tasks confront existing team members who get a laptop replacement, or a trainer who needs to set up environments for application training. These are just some of the use cases for automating the setup of workstations using the “as code” approach. Scripting your Windows environment, for example, will deliver benefits such as: Developers may make mistakes by downloading software and installing it without verifying the authenticity of the download and the site that they are downloading it from. The “as code” approach eliminates this risk by ensuring that you always get the correct, legitimate software by configuring the setup to download from a trusted repository. Speed of deployment and setup is improved by automating the retrieval of executables from the trusted repository Version updates can be easily managed and distributed across the entire organisation. Setup is less likely to fail because the version and configuration of the software is controlled by the script. The “as code” approach thus reduces the effort needed to set up environments and workstations, enabling teams to achieve better time-to-value, and to deliver greater flexibility and agility to the organisation.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  The DevOps movement is about being able to deliver applications fast through automation, and having a shift left mentality where testing is performed earlier in the project lifecycle. As DevOps teams become more and more mature, concerns about testing, quality assurance and deployment are now being addressed earlier during the development process. But there remains one stumbling block which is preventing quick releases - security. To address this, the next logical step is to embed security into DevOps. From secure development perspective, there are different aspects that need to be covered. These include delivery practice, application security, infrastructure controls, and monitoring to ensure that compliance is maintained throughout the phases of development and operations. Below are some of the best practices that we would recommend for the design of a DevSecOps framework. Whether you are using the agile or waterfall development model, it is good to practise secure coding by regularly scanning your code and open source libraries, at least on a daily basis. You have to do both the   and   using tools that can detect the top security issues identified by the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP). Scanning should not stop at the code level. You should also scan for vulnerabilities while doing unit and functional tests using   A good tool should be able to follow the path of requests to any component of the application with full traceability to any vulnerabilities in the component. Finally, it is also a good practice to simulate attacks and try to penetrate your application from your front-end service using a  tool. Running all types of security testing in parallel with continuous integration lowers the risks of introducing vulnerabilities that could lead to security breaches. It is always a good idea to not allow any access to an application until the entity that is requesting access (device, user, system or application) is verified. Tighten verification by using token-based authentication, trusted certificates and multi-factor authentication. DevSecOps advocates the implementation of “security policy as code” which not only allows policies to be pushed out easily but also aids in monitoring compliance and maintaining (add, remove, update) policies. Using a configuration management tool to implement the “as code” approach will enable full automation and continuous compliance monitoring for environments including cloud, on-premises infrastructures and middleware.

                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  DevSecOps is supposed to introduce speed and efficiency into the application development cycle while ensuring security is embedded into every part of the process. For one government agency, the current DevSecOps pipeline designed was inefficient and not maintainable. The organisation wanted to make several changes in its applications and was relying on DevSecOps tools to get the job done quickly and efficiently. DevSecOps was expected to create a highly-collaborative environment between the developers and product owners, allowing the applications to be developed within two to three months using Agile Sprints. However, what it ended up with were processes that were difficult to manage, leading to high overheads. Due to limitations in the network environment, the continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) processes were isolated from each other, which went contrary to the principles and practices of DevOps design and created issues with pipeline management. Governance and traceability were also lacking, with little visibility into the version of codes that were being deployed into the production environment. NCS was invited to redesign the DevSecOps process and find ways to leverage the organisation’s existing investment in tools to bring application and release management teams together to participate in and review the software release process. After reviewing the state of DevSecOps in the organisation, NCS proposed setting up a collaborative environment where developers and users could work from multiple locations to reduce cost, while being able to exchange information seamlessly. It also proposed improvements to how DevSecOps tools could be used for the development of proof-of-concepts and applications. For example, the Jenkins CI/CD pipeline was redesigned using “Pipeline as Code” to improve maintainability, with the pipeline code maintained using the DevOps lifecycle tool GitLab to ensure proper version control. The “Multibranch Pipeline” approach was also applied to automatically discover, manage and execute pipelines for branches and provide instant feedback on the status of each source code branch. Shift left practices, where testing is performed earlier in the project lifecycle, were also recommended to ensure quality code and deliverables. Another step that NCS took was to re-evaluate plugins for the task management platform Jira and the collaboration software program Confluence, as well as the AWS EC2 instance types used by the DevOps tools to better manage operating costs. The collaborative platform proposed by NCS enabled the product owner and developer to work together and document the application development process more efficiently. This helped development teams to shorten project iterations and reduce the time taken from project approval to “go-live”, while ensuring that the end-product was acceptable to the customer. Governance was enhanced with continuous feedback and improved traceability for different revisions, versions and releases, and management overheads were reduced through the use of the CI/CD process to manage the incremental build of the product. At the same time, elimination of unnecessary plugins and instances helped reduce operating costs while the use of the AWS Relational Database Service enhanced the availability and reliability of the databases required for the DevOps tools including GitLab, SonarQube, Jira and Confluence.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  Employees are real asset to organisation. They are a great source of ideas for improving work processes, reducing administration complexity by introducing innovations to existing work processes. Recognising this, an organisation in Singapore wanted to find a way to evaluate staff ideas and convert the better ones into projects that will benefit the employees, administration and customers. It came up with the concept of a Digital factory that would speed up the process from ideation to realisation. However, it also recognised that its procurement processes were complex, with lengthy evaluation processes that meant it could take a long time to implement any staff suggestion. What the organisation needed was a way to test some of the employees’ ideas and fail them early if they did not look like they could deliver any benefits. The way to do this was through proofs of concepts (POCs) – simple projects developed within a span of 2-3 months to capture and evaluate the ideas and assess the potential benefits. These could be delivered either as services on the corporate Intranet or as mobile applications. Developing the POCs would require a highly collaborative environment where developers and project owners from different sites could exchange information and work together efficiently and cost-effectively. To address this, NCS recommended that the organisation use Amazon Web Services (AWS) to create the environment and tap on DevSecOps tools from AWS and other technology providers to develop the POCs. NCS worked with the organisation to set up a fully-collaborative environment where development teams and project owners can come together to document and develop a product that would be acceptable to end customer. The AWS platform allows multiple projects to be built at the same time, with common components that can be shared, reducing the development effort. The entire development is aided by continuous integration/continuous delivery process to manage the incremental build of the product. Shift left practices, which incorporate testing earlier in the development process, is applied to ensure the quality of code and deliverables. By using a cloud platform, development teams are also able to spin off managed Instances to support the applications as and when they are needed These shorten the development cycle, enabling projects to go-live so that good ideas can come to fruition more quickly to deliver benefits across the organisation.

                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  Many organisations today own IT applications that might be outdated, which results in inefficiencies and inefficacy in service delivery and outcome. To create new business value, organisations need to undergo application modernisation. As tempting as it is to retain legacy systems, the cost of doing so is often too high. Too many resources are required to update and maintain the legacy system. Even if these pain points can be tolerated, problems will snowball as newer operating systems are introduced into the system. People, culture, and systems often get in the way of change in digital transformation within organisation. Take the movement of IT assets from a host environment to a new one as an example. It is a sophisticated process which many organisations struggle to carry out. Deciding how to start the application modernisation process is a key challenge faced by most organisations. Taking a real-life example of bringing some IT assets from a host environment to a new one with limited time and a tight budget, it is important to keep the end-state or business goals in mind for each persona: citizen, implementation team and service owner. The key is to empathise with different stakeholders and understand the different priorities that each stakeholder has. Doing so will make the application modernisation process a lot easier to start. More often than not, organisations and stakeholders are too eager to roll out solutions, missing out on the ideation process. Being able to put yourself in the shoes of the end users before coming up with a solution is a key learning point. For project implementation, project management and compliance are key priorities. Equipping organisations with a team of people with the right skillsets remains important. So are tools and channels of communication between end users and organisations to derive the true performance of a given solution. As technology evolves, capturing real-time information to assess performance and user uptake become easier. Consequently, implementing government services will become more responsive, available, accurate and anticipatory in nature. Overall, citizen satisfaction will improve. Another point to note is that the line between service owner and implementation team are often blurred. So roles need to be clearly defined to build good partnerships and relationships within the teams. Choosing the right service provider, in terms of cost, quality and value, are also instrumental in the overarching concern of protecting the government’s image. In terms of operational risks and factors of implementing applications, an interesting idea was brought up in relation to the public sector, application modernisation should focus more on value especially among the higher echelons of government. Coined as “Value of Government”, the political leadership should be operationally driven. Acting as a new source of motivation, governments should rethink how they can deliver exceptional value and how to respond, anticipate and especially delight its citizens. Microservices and lo-code services - the former was a hot choice among attendees given the granularity it affords, is quick and the most agile to implement. Nevertheless, context, nature, usage and consistency were factors to consider before implementing microservices as a tool. Ultimately, application modernisation is a gradual process. The key is whether there is an orchestration mechanism, be it in the implementation team or through the service owner, to meld all considerations; systems, people and work culture, and present a cohesive strategy to stakeholders for delivery. At the end of the day, every organisation’s battle hymn will be different. Despite the chaos, every transformation has a flow. The real challenge in modernising legacy applications is knowing your organisation’s needs and capabilities. Organisations and Governments will continue to transform to find a sweet spot between customer satisfaction and harnessing the power of IT solutions.

             You can drop us a call or email NCS provides AWS certified expertise to help enterprises with DevSecOps cloud transformation to improve cost savings and performance When developing   solution, one needs to understand the customer's environment, their current processes and the expectations from the implementation. In NCS, we believe that implementing DevSecOps solution is a culture change in development practices. Customer needs to adapt to this change to take full advantage of this implementation.   Enterprises are shifting from DevOps to DevSecOps. This security-centric approach to application development creates transparency, process governance, mitigation of vulnerabilities and responsiveness to deviations. The DevSecOps model covers security elements and continuous improvements and development (CI/CD) of the pipeline, which includes automation and auditing of security operations. To this end, organisations can embed security knowledge, application know-how and automate processes to create security at scale. Setting up a scalable and resilient IT system is an expensive endeavour that comes with building and maintaining physical infrastructure. To circumnavigate these time-consuming activities and high cost, enterprises can implement DevSecOps cybersecurity in AWS cloud services. Teams can focus their energy and resources to building secure, high-performing applications to meet market demands. To support the migration of the DevSecOps pipeline to the cloud, NCS has partnered Amazon Web Services (AWS). In support of your cloud transformation journey, NCS provides end-to-end implementation of AWS products. In partnership with AWS cloud services, NCS offers AWS trained technologists and certified professionals in DevSecOps to derive the most value from your cloud transformation. Thank you for your enquiry! We'll get back to you as soon we can.
