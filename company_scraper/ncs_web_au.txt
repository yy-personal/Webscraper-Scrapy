             You can drop us a call or email Published:  Members of the public may need police assistance in parks and remote areas where police officers are not immediately present. NCS worked with the Singapore Police Force to deliver the Police Beacon: a contemporary ‘police box’ integrating cameras, sensors and communications technology, providing the public with real-time access to the Police in times of emergencies, and assistance before Police Officers arrive at the scene.  As Singapore moves to provide more and more public parks and spaces for play, its citizens are spending more time out and about – meaning the chances of someone needing assistance are also increasing. But it’s not feasible for police officers to be everywhere, all the time.  NCS collaborated with the Singapore Police Force (SPF) and the Home Team Science and Technology Agency (HTX) – to bring a real-time, 24/7 police presence to public places in the form of the Police Beacon. Through cameras, sensors and communications equipment, the Police Beacon helps members of the public connect to the police quickly and directly during times of emergencies, enabling the police to provide information and assistance remotely. NCS worked alongside SPF and HTX as the key partner for technology, fabrication, configuration, testing, and commissioning.    Communications access to Police services during emergencies  Real-time video footage to enhance sense-making  Remote access to blinkers, sirens, floodlights and speakers which serve as interim intervention options to provide assistance before Police officers arrive  The Police Beacon is just one of the many ways the Singapore Police Force is exploring and adapting new technologies to achieve its vision of making Singapore the safest place in the world. In operation 24/7, it serves as a visible projection of police presence while enhancing public safety.  “While the various technologies mounted on the Police Beacon are not new, this is the first time we are pulling them together into one single platform…Throughout this process, the team remained focused on the key intent of the Police Beacon – to allow the Police to better serve the public.”  Lionel Lee, Deputy Superintendent of Police, Operations Department Share this article on: Discover how you can chart your career and elevate your skills.

Within days of applications closing, the system would have computed the various options filled in by the students, factored in special admission criteria, different admission schemes and other parameters, and matched each application against available places to arrive at the posting results, which are then communicated to students via SMS or online. The JAE backend system is one of several developed by NCS to support the student cycle from primary one registration to the administration of the post-secondary education accounts. The Primary One System is used to register pupils a year before they are slated to begin school. As they move on to the next phase of their education, the Secondary One System supports the annual secondary one posting exercise where students who pass their Primary School Leaving Examinations (PSLE) are posted to a secondary school based on their results and choice of schools. On completion of secondary school, the JAE system handles postings for the next phase of the student’s education journey. At each juncture, where there is a national examination, the Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board uses the web-based iExams system to manage the operations.

The successful rollout of SSOE 2 enabled schools to leverage ICT more effectively for teaching and learning. Innovations and enhancements Transitioning to SSOE 2 Outcomes NCS service involvement explore more 
                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  The Schools Standard ICT Operating Environment (SSOE) was started in 2009 by the Singapore Ministry of Education (MOE) to consolidate the provisioning and management of desktops, network and ICT support for MOE schools in Singapore. SSOE 2, which was awarded to NCS in March 2017, was the second iteration of the project, building on the successful model of the original while updating it with newer technologies and innovations. In SSOE 2, new products and features such as 2-in-1 notebooks were introduced, together with better and wider wireless coverage and more robust security. The new notebooks had touchscreen capabilities that enabled them to be used like a tablet with handwriting recognition capabilities. The aim was to untether the notebook from the desk, giving teachers more freedom to focus on pedagogy and not be restricted to the front of the classroom. NCS also redesigned the Procurement Portal which allowed schools to order ICT products and services from multiple vendors by making it as intuitive as an online shopping site. This made the procurement process easier for users. NCS also introduced a value-added Innovation Programme where we collaborated closely with MOE on ideas to enhance the user experience in the schools’ environment. We built an innovation portal for schools to submit ideas. Teachers could then cast votes to decide which ideas could be developed into proofs of concepts. Another major innovation that was introduced with SSOE 2 was the automation of delivery of the SSOE 2 systems to schools where the deployment of school infrastructure (servers and virtual machines) reduced the turnaround from 4 days to 1 day. This improved the efficiency of systems delivery enabled more schools to transition to SSOE 2 much more quickly and benefit from its new features and capabilities.ing and learning. The transition consisted of a pilot phase, which was followed by mass deployment to all schools. Whilst the NCS team continued to innovate on the technology front to ensure that things were done fast and done right, there was also a lot of coordination work involved to ensure that the transition to SSOE 2 went smoothly. For example, the introduction of 2-in-1 notebooks - which were meant to be light notebooks that could be carried around easily for use anywhere - initially met with challenges, with feedback that the screens were too hot, USB ports were insufficient and issues with detachable keyboard. In response to the feedback, besides making modifications to the notebook settings to mitigate the hot screen issue and issuing USB hubs to add more ports,   to familiarise the teachers with the use of the new devices. The change management team leveraged different strategies to ensure minimal disruption to schools and teachers. For example, it adopted different communication strategies to educate teachers on the changes.  The SSOE 2 rollout brought MOE’s ICT infrastructure to the next level to better support teaching and learning needs across schools. School-wide wireless was rolled out to all 354 MOE schools within the short span of a year, extending coverage to key teaching and learning areas impacting over 30,000 teachers and 400,000 students. New messaging services were also deployed smoothly to schools, with an on-boarding process designed from the user perspective to facilitate the transition. Operationally, the SSOE 2 Procurement Portal made it easier and more convenient for MOE staff to order ICT devices. The NCS Change Management team was also lauded for its innovative change management efforts and initiatives. Its video series The Mr Aaron Show managed to get between 3,000 and 6,000 views for each video just weeks after the broadcast. From a cost perspective, the deployment of future-proof technologies such as virtualisation, Gigabit networks and a hyper-converged architecture has helped to reduce the server footprint, improve network performance and hosting overheads for MOE. Overall, initiatives under SSOE 2 resulted in a more cost-efficient infrastructure and useful services that enable schools to leverage ICT more effectively for teach Share this article on: Discover how you can chart you career and elevate your skills.

Companies have successfully transformed their businesses by leveraging data insights ranging from individual customer preferences and behaviour to broad industry developments. However, some tourism companies may be slower to make use of this capability because of lack of expertise, limited resources, and lack of access to good quality data. To address this challenge, the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) has taken the lead in building a centralised   to give tourism businesses cost-effective access to a data analytics platform where they can share and consume data. This platform, that the Singapore Tourism Board commissioned NCS to develop, is to encourage the adoption of a common data taxonomy with more standardised data formats, which in turn facilitates data exchange and sets the stage for raising data analytics capabilities across the industry. With the launch of Stan, STB will engage tourism industry businesses including hotels, attractions, MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions) companies and travel agencies on how to adopt Stan in their work. In future updates of Stan, the tourism industry can look forward to enhanced capabilities such as advanced data visualisation and analytics, leveraging trustworthy data from STB and industry. Industry partners can make use of private spaces to explore their own data, and share consumer tourism-related data through a data marketplace. Stan also provides industry partners with sandboxes to collaborate and co-create use cases for new products and services. This latest development will help the tourism industry take a significant step forward in its digital transformation efforts as it seeks to discover new opportunities and redefine the visitor experience in Singapore Share this article on: Discover how you can chart your career and elevate your skills.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  As a government body with H.E.A.R.T. at the centre of its service mission, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) of Singapore envisioned its contact centre to be more customer-centric. H.E.A.R.T. is a set of service principles - Hear them out, Make it Easy, Anticipate their needs, Respect every individual, Be Timely – that underpins MOM’s customer experience programme and business objectives. To meet the evolving needs and expectations of its stakeholders and callers, the Ministry embarked on a contact centre transformation to help its call agents better manage calls and customer feedback. The MOM Contact Centre handles all incoming calls and various other forms of contact from the public. The transformation of the contact centre involved improving internal processes and implementing digital technologies such as advanced analytics, robotic process automation, voice recognition technology and performance dashboards. Incoming voice calls to the centre are managed by an Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) where the users can perform self-help or request for agent assistance. As part of the contact centre transformation, extensive data collection technologies and analytics were implemented across multiple systems, enabling MOM to better able to track caller behaviour and understand their needs. Robotic Process Automation was introduced to help contact centre agents with user account management. The technology automates the creation of user accounts and helps assign the relevant privileges. A Whole-of-Centre Performance Dashboard was also created for the contact centre’s call and email agents. The customised dashboard allows managers and team leaders to track overall performance while agents can track their own work performance throughout the day. At the same time, voice recognition technology was implemented to facilitate customer feedback surveys. At the end of a call, a customer could respond to the survey by using a voice command. The use of advanced analytics has enabled the contact centre to segment its caller base more accurately. Relevant information can now be streamlined and delivered to callers via the personalised IVRS even before they speak with an agent. Where suitable, callers can also be directed to more efficient service channels such as a self-help menu. Robotic Process Automation has also helped improve operational efficiency in the contact centre by eliminating most of the manual steps involved in account creation and shortening the time taken by up to 75%. The introduction of other capabilities such as user feedback tracking, IVR analytics and performance analytics also enables MOM to establish a service quality framework and system to ensure continuous improvement and service excellence. As MOM continues to deliver even greater customer experiences, NCS is working with the ministry to apply design thinking to generate new ideas for process improvements and operational advanced responsiveness. Using NCS’ DRIVE Design Thinking approach, we are exploring new solutions that can be implemented to solve problems, better equip call agents, automate processes and build a call centre infrastructure that is future-ready.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:   - Singtel today signed agreements with Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (NTU Singapore) and the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) to spearhead R&D efforts in emerging technologies that will support Singapore’s transformation into Smart Nation and help enable the country’s digital economy. Under a five-year partnership, Singtel, NTU Singapore and the National Research Foundation Singapore (NRF Singapore) will establish a S$42.4 million corporate lab, to be called Singtel Cognitive and Artificial Intelligence Lab for Enterprises (SCALE@NTU), to develop applications for use in the areas of public safety, smart urban solutions, transportation, healthcare and manufacturing. The partners, through their collective expertise and resources, aim to accelerate innovation in the fields of AI, advanced data analytics, robotics and smart computing. Mr Bill Chang, Chief Executive Officer, Group Enterprise at Singtel, said, “This collaboration marks a significant step for Singtel to develop intellectual property in emerging technologies to support enterprises in their digital transformation and Singapore’s Smart Nation objectives. As businesses face the rising threat of technological disruptions, companies are constantly seeking innovative ways to gain deeper insights through data analytics, better engage their customers and transform their operations through digitalisation. To help companies address these challenges, we are stepping up our R&D efforts to develop deep capabilities in these focused areas.” The research by SCALE@NTU aims to resolve various challenges faced by cities in keeping their infrastructure facilities in tip top running condition. With the use of smart sensors embedded with AI, city governments can analyse data from infrastructure facilities and can decide to conduct maintenance works only when necessary to achieve optimal performance for these assets. This would help cut operating costs for cities that currently spend significant amounts on routine maintenance, whilst not compromising on infrastructure quality and performance standards. Professor Lam Khin Yong, NTU’s Acting Provost, Chief of Staff and Vice President (Research) said, “For Singapore to achieve its Smart Nation vision, we have to keep pushing the frontiers of AI and develop innovative ways to process, analyse and utilise big data. This is how the collaborative effort between Singtel and NTU on cognitive computing will make a huge impact, improving productivity for businesses while making our cities smarter and more efficient.” Over the next five years, this partnership is expected to expand the product range of Singtel and its regional ICT subsidiary NCS. Some 100 researchers from Singtel and NTU will work at SCALE@NTU, while another 200 research engineers, graduate and undergraduate students will also be trained in the lab. The collaboration builds on NTU’s strong expertise in AI and data science, with the university ranked world No. 2 by Nikkei and Elsevier for having the most-cited research papers in these areas. Mr George Loh, NRF Singapore’s Director (Programmes), said, “This latest collaboration between Singtel and NTU underscores the significance of developing research expertise and capabilities in advanced analytics for Singapore to be a leading provider of smart city solutions. The lab will provide a platform for researchers and engineers from both academia and industry to work together to translate cutting-edge research into digital solutions and offerings by our companies, while nurturing a pipeline of digital talent who can drive Singapore’s Smart Nation journey.” Singtel and A*STAR will also work together on projects including smart building automation systems, robotics and Internet of Things (IoT) applications that could help boost operating efficiencies in various industries. Robots can be deployed to handle biohazardous waste, allowing companies to deploy their employees to undertake higher value-added jobs. Such technologies can be tested on Singtel’s NarrowBand-IoT and 5G mobile network in a model factory to be set up by A*STAR next year. Professor Tan Sze Wee, Executive Director of the Science and Engineering Research Council at A*STAR, said, “Public-private partnerships and open innovation pave the way for successful projects that could benefit the Singapore economy and lives of Singaporeans. In this age where disruptions are emerging rapidly, such joint collaborations are all the more valuable. A*STAR is happy to partner with Singtel to drive R&D in the latest technologies towards applications across industries.” Share this article on: Explore our thinking and services that help to shape various industries through technology.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:   – NCS today announced its acquisition of Australia’s largest privately-owned IT services company, The Dialog Group (Dialog), to better support the Australian public sector and enterprise clients in addressing their rising digital transformation needs. The acquisition of Dialog for A$325 million (S$325 million) is geared to unlock new growth opportunities in the Australian market and accelerate NCS’ regionalisation strategy. Reputed for its extensive services portfolio from IT consulting, application development to managed application services, Dialog has presence across Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra, Perth, Darwin, and Adelaide. , said, “This acquisition is a significant step in the regionalisation of NCS and leverages the combined strengths of NCS and Dialog and their established track records and reputations across both Singapore and Australia. The scale of this acquisition, our largest to date, reflects our firm commitment to growing our business beyond the shores of Singapore, particularly in Australia where we can also leverage the strategic presence of the Singtel Group.” The acquisition combines Dialog’s core IT capabilities and NCS NEXT digital services to bolster its focus on innovation, cloud, artificial intelligence and data analytics. It also trebles the number of highly skilled IT specialists in its operations in Australia to 1,300 - ready to support clients from a multitude of sectors including government, healthcare, transport, communications, financial and commercial services. This combination of talent and expertise will create a stronger end-to-end suite of technology and digital services for NCS’ clients in Australia and across the region. Ng added, “At NCS, our purpose is to advance our communities by harnessing technology and bringing people together to make the extraordinary happen. Similarly, Dialog’s commitment to clients and technology has made it one of the leading tech companies in Australia, serving both government and enterprise clients. This alignment of purpose makes Dialog a perfect fit. Collectively, our capabilities, talent and reach will fortify and consolidate our position in Australia and help our clients and the industry meet the digital transformation demands of the future economy.” As part of its transformational growth plan, NCS has been scaling its presence in Australia since December 2020 to serve clients in Australia through NCS NEXT, its digital innovation and services arm - which supports enterprises’ growing demand for digital transformation solutions. Together, Dialog and NCS will have greater opportunities for synergistic growth between Australia and Singapore as well as expertise to better support the needs of clients across both markets. This latest deal follows NCS NEXT’s acquisition of Riley, a cloud consultancy with dedicated expertise in Google cloud applications and a majority investment in Eighty20 Solutions, a cloud transformation specialist with unique capabilities across Microsoft cloud platforms, thus offering a ‘best-of-cloud' service portfolio to the Australian market. Mr Alan Key, Dialog’s CEO commented, “Together, we will have a strong breadth and depth of capabilities and expertise for our clients here in Australia. Both NCS and Dialog’s talent development cultures and programmes will develop the best talent pipeline and create exciting jobs and growth opportunities.” According to Gartner, IT spending in Australia is showing its strongest growth in a decade and is projected to grow 6.5% in 2022. The largest IT spending segment in Australia is IT services, which is expected to grow to A$39 billion in 2022 . With one of the highest Net-Promoter Scores (NPS) in the industry and a long-standing client base of governments and large enterprises, Dialog understands the unique needs of the market and augments NCS’ commitment to better serve a diverse range of clients in Government, Healthcare, Transportation, Financial Services, Industrial, Commercial, Communications, Media, and Technology sectors. Government and enterprise clients can now access deep-tech capabilities across 55 specialisations to support their transformation needs including harnessing innovative digital and cloud technologies. They will also be able to leverage synergies from NCS NEXT Innovation Centres, spanning Singapore and Melbourne, to drive innovation through cross-border collaboration and co-creation. The newly combined NCS and Dialog will unlock synergies in talent development and build a steady pipeline of tech talent for the Australian market. With the increased market presence, NCS and Dialog employees will have more options to achieve personal growth and mastery, opportunities to move across specialisations and work in various regions and industries, with different clients and partners to gain a wide range of experience. Depending on their skillsets and areas of interest, they also get to be involved in exciting and impactful projects, reflecting NCS’ commitment to building a place for talent to grow and thrive professionally. The completion of the acquisition is subject to fulfilment of closing conditions, including relevant approvals from regulatory authorities and other third parties, and is expected to be completed within three months.

                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:   - As part of Prudential’s customer-centric approach, the life insurer has launched an industry-first chatbot that can provide its Financial Consultants with real-time information specific to their customers’ life insurance plans. Named askPRU, the cognitive-powered chatbot is built on IBM Watson technology and integrated into Prudential’s backend systems. It is able to retrieve instantly data such as a customer’s policy cash value, policy premium due date and status of submitted claims, among others. As askPRU operates round the clock, Prudential’s Financial Consultants can communicate with the chatbot via a mobile application at any time of the day to obtain information pertaining to their customers’ insurance plans, enabling them to be more productive and more responsive. Using IBM Watson’s Conversation Service, askPRU has been trained by NCS’ data scientists1 to understand non-scripted questions, probe users to get to the intent of their queries and deliver responses in a way that simulates human conversations. Since the pilot launch of askPRU in July, more than half of Prudential’s 4,000 Financial Consultants have started to use the chatbot. Ms. Theresa Nai, Chief Operating Officer at Prudential Singapore, said, askPRU is part of Prudential’s commitment to continuously improve the service experience for its customers. “In today’s fast-paced, time-starved environment, our customers do not have the patience to wait for information. With askPRU, our Financial Consultants can now get faster access to customer-specific information and respond to their customers’ queries even more promptly. askPRU is one of the ways in which we digitally enable our Financial Consultants so they are equipped to meet increasing consumer demands and expectations,” said Ms Nai. askPRU complements PRUONE Express, an enhanced digital point-of-sales portal, to help Prudential’s Financial Consultants engage their customers more efficiently. For instance, PRUONE Express is able to generate a detailed quotation in just three seconds and uses the latest technologies, such as SmartData Capture and Fingerprint Authentication, to facilitate a quicker and more effective consultation and sales process. Launched earlier this month, all of Prudential’s Financial Consultants currently have access to PRUONE Express to complete their sales process and to submit new policy requests. Apart from improving customer experience, askPRU also creates operational efficiencies for the life insurer. Prudential estimates that approximately 30 per cent of its Financial Consultants’ queries received by its Contact Centre consultants today can be answered by askPRU. With frequently-asked queries channelled to the chatbot, Prudential’s Contact Centre consultants will be able to focus on handling more complex enquiries and provide a better service to its Financial Consultants and customers. Designed as a standalone mobile application, askPRU was developed in collaboration with NCS Pte Ltd (NCS), IBM Watson and Nokomai Studios. IBM Watson is a cognitive computing technology platform that uses natural language processing and machine learning to reveal insights from large amounts of structured and unstructured data, such as text and images. Mr. Chia Wee Boon, Chief Executive Officer of NCS, said, “We are pleased to work with Prudential to develop a cognitive-powered chatbot that provides responsive, 24/7 support to its Financial Consultants. Notably, the integration of the chatbot to Prudential’s core backend systems ensures that there is always a reliable and consistent source of information available, which translates to the Financial Consultants and their customers having instant access to accurate, real-time information.” Mr. Kenny Hay, Director of Cloud, IBM ASEAN, said, “The way in which customer relationships are built is constantly evolving. Technology such as IBM Watson has cognitive capabilities that often serve to augment human intelligence and abilities, supporting Prudential’s Financial Consultants. The pathway to self-service in real-time can certainly bring about huge growth opportunities for forward-thinking businesses.” Ms. Mae Urquhart, Director of Nokomai Studios, said, “It is a privilege to work with Prudential in transforming the data-driven expertise of NCS and IBM into an intuitive, engaging experience for the life insurer’s Financial Consultants. In particular, the close collaboration with Prudential’s Financial Consultants was crucial in the successful development of askPRU.” Keen to arrange a Data Analytics demo or to find out more?

             You can drop us a call or email Published:   - As part of a series of initiatives focusing on digital innovation, MSIG Insurance (“MSIG”) has introduced Robotic Process Automation (RPA) software into its process workflows. NCS Pte Ltd, a leading information communications technology service provider and a subsidiary of Singtel, designed the bots using UIPath RPA software. “Robotic Processing Automation presents an opportunity for insurers to digitise their processes further and enhance customer experience through faster turnaround times. NCS’ deep experience in implementing RPA has enabled us to roll out the initiative within a very short timeframe. We are seeing increased agility in our processes now that our employees are freed up to focus on higher value-added tasks. Our partnership with NCS has produced great results and we look forward to this ongoing collaboration,” said Ms Sharon Teo, Senior Vice President, Corporate Services and Project Management Office of MSIG Insurance. Mr Chia Wee Boon, Chief Executive Officer of NCS, said, “We are pleased to help MSIG leverage our expertise in Robotic Processing Automation to improve their customer experience with faster, more accurate processes. With the growing emphasis on business process enhancement through automation, we look forward to continuing our partnership with MSIG as they embrace innovation to transform customer engagement and be at the forefront of this changing technology landscape.” MSIG’s two newcomers to its virtual workforce – named Zac and Velma – have helped to improve process efficiency, cutting down the time spent on travel claims registration and motor fleet policy processing by around 70% and 80% respectively. Both bots are able to eliminate error rates by 100%. Zac processes travel claims submitted over the website, saving MSIG staff from the repetitive task of manually entering information into the system and printing out acknowledgement letters to send to claimants. Zac automates the process with immediate registration of claimant details upon online submission, and emails an acknowledgement to the claimant. This cuts down the processing time for MSIG’s travel claims registration and acknowledgement from 14 minutes to 3 minutes. Velma enters the vehicle details of new motor fleet policies into the system. Instead of taking the average 2 minutes to key in one vehicle policy, she takes 40 seconds. She is also able to handle policy validation and cancel maid or foreign workers’ policies with expired bonds from the system when instructed. Following the successful implementation of Zac and Velma, MSIG and NCS have plans to extend the partnership even further with the development of more RPAs over the next 6 months. They will develop bots to improve claims registration and policy processing for other product lines, and will extend the use of bots to other department processes if they require automation. The investment in RPA will form part of the digital roadmap that MSIG has set out to ultimately simplify customer experience and empower its employees at work.

On behalf of Singtel’s management, I wish to thank him for his dedication and contributions in building and bringing NCS to where it is today.” Under Mr Chia’s leadership, NCS revenues grew 60% to S$1.8 billion.

  – NCS today launched NEXT Shenzhen Innovation Centre (SIC) in China to drive innovation and talent development aimed at helping enterprise clients accelerate their digital transformation efforts. The SIC will bolster NCS’ growth strategy as it expands its presence in the Greater China market to provide regional clients direct access to leading-edge technologies and expertise.
 
Located at Tian’an Cloud Park in Shenzhen, NCS’ first innovation centre in China will specialise in developing 5G-enabled IoT applications, digital twin and blockchain solutions for industries such as financial services, telecommunications and real estate. The SIC houses a demonstration area, design thinking studio and digital factory in a 1,400 square metre space, where clients can work closely with NCS’ team of resident experts to jointly develop digital projects to improve business performance and unlock new growth opportunities. The centre will serve as a hub to fuel the growth of a cross-border innovation ecosystem for NCS’ clients, partners and tech start-ups.
 
  said, “The launch of NCS NEXT Shenzhen Innovation Centre underscores our commitment to help our clients in Asia Pacific transform by harnessing the best of digital innovation. The SIC forms part of NCS NEXT Innovation Triangle, through which our clients can tap NCS’ innovation capabilities in Singapore, Melbourne and Shenzhen to get access to best-of-breed technologies, digital capabilities and deep-tech talent across the region. We are pleased to partner our clients and partners to build a cross-border innovation ecosystem to facilitate the exchange of ideas and experiences. The establishment of SIC also provides a growth platform for Singaporeans to gain wider exposure to the innovation landscape in China, providing opportunities for ICT students and professionals to collaborate on innovative projects in Shenzhen.”
 
  said, “IMDA congratulates NCS on the opening of the NEXT Shenzhen Innovation Centre. The Shenzhen Innovation Centre will boost the development of innovation and talent initiatives in the region, promoting cross-border innovation and talent exchange. We hope that the centre will create new exciting opportunities for businesses and communities to drive trade and connectivity in a digital economy.”
 
Since its establishment as China’s first economic zone, Shenzhen has become a hub for innovation and investments. NCS will be collaborating with ecosystem partners and clients in Singapore and China to drive initiatives with a focus on digital innovation. DBS, one of the SIC’s anchor tenants, plans to leverage the innovation centre to testbed innovations using emerging technologies such as 5G, IoT and blockchain to enable greater cross-border collaboration, increased trade flows and better workforce engagement.
 
  said, “With innovation being a key driver of economic growth and recovery in the post-COVID-19 next normal, it is crucial for companies to tap on the strengths of ecosystem partners and networks to augment technology resources and grow supply chains. DBS is pleased to partner IMDA and NCS in establishing the NEXT Shenzhen Innovation Centre, which will be an important digital springboard for businesses looking to expand their presence in China. DBS is uniquely positioned to avail our deep digital and financial capabilities as well as regional insights to support companies on both sides of the border to grow their business as trade activity between Singapore and Shenzhen ramps up. This partnership will also enable us to access technology resources to complement our twin technology hubs in Singapore and Hyderabad.”
 
The SIC will also play an important role in driving talent development through job attachments and rotations. NCS will offer talent exchange opportunities for its employees to be deployed at the centre to promote cross-pollination of ideas and to develop cross-cultural skills. In addition, NCS will also offer internships for Singapore and Shenzhen students under the Singapore-China Youth Interns Exchange Scheme.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:   – The Singapore National Eye Centre (SNEC) has partnered with NCS to design, build, and deploy a new Appointment Scheduling Optimiser (ASO) to transform clinic operations, reduce patient waiting times and allocate manpower and resources more efficiently. The ASO taps on NCS NEXT’s capabilities in artificial intelligence (AI), advanced analytics, and machine learning technology on patient and operational data to perform optimal supply-demand matching, thus ensuring patient appointments are matched optimally with available clinical resources. The ASO is scheduled for rollout in the fourth quarter of 2021 and is planned for further scaling and deployment across all SingHealth institutions to improve overall clinic operational efficiency, elevating patient satisfaction and experience. Annually, SNEC manages a workload of 360,000 patient visits in its Specialist Outpatient Clinics.  said, “Currently, appointment scheduling for all patient visits including those requiring initial consultations and the necessary same-day eye services and investigations is a time and labour-intensive process handled by appointment staff. To address the growing volume of appointment requests and limited visibility over demand at multiple service stations resulting in bottlenecks and long clinic waiting times, SNEC collaborated with NCS to leverage the Appointment Scheduling Optimiser to resolve the various pain points.” NCS will deploy advanced data and predictive analytics as well as machine learning to tailor an in-house schedule optimisation ASO platform. Using SNEC data sets with exact patient and operational requirements, AI algorithms perform supply-demand matching and appointment schedule optimisation is done continuously and incrementally with minimal human intervention, until an optimal daily schedule is reached, matching confirmed patient appointments with all available clinical resources.  said, “We are delighted with this opportunity to work with SNEC to play a critical role in the digitalisation of healthcare services that will have a tangible impact on the end-to-end patient journey. The first-of-its-kind in Singapore, the Appointment Scheduling Optimiser marks the first of many use cases in healthcare, such as the improved allocation of hospital beds, operating theatres, and even optimising valuable nurse-to-patient staffing for better care. The Appointment Scheduling Optimiser is an example of how digitalisation of business operations can revolutionise customer outcomes.” The ASO operates on NCS’ proprietary Enterprise Schedule Optimisation Platform which offers the opportunity to scale the capabilities of the smart scheduling solution, offering businesses in a range of industries beyond the healthcare sector greater flexibility to customise solutions to better suit their needs. The ASO will leverage data analytics to better predict future resourcing demand, enhance optimisation and improve long-term resource allocation as well as operational efficiency.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:     – NCS today announced a major business and people transformation to reposition the company for growth in the 5G era. The strategic reset focuses on growing digital services, scaling its government and telco business segments and capturing new growth opportunities in the enterprise sector, across the key regional markets of Singapore, Australia and Greater China. The move comes as digital economies experience a global growth spurt, accelerated in part by COVID-19, creating an unprecedented surge in demand for digital and technology services. Ng Kuo Pin, CEO of NCS said, “There isn’t a more opportune time for us to make the pivot from a traditional ICT service provider to a digital and technology services firm in Asia Pacific. COVID-19 and the mass migration online have put digital transformation on everyone’s agenda, and we intend to leverage our strengths in the public and telco sectors to capitalise on this opportunity to redefine and grow our company. We will be ramping up our offering of digital services as we reposition ourselves to capture new business from the enterprise sector and expand into the high-growth markets of Australia and Greater China where we have presence and synergies.” Earlier in May, NCS was cited as a new growth engine for the Singtel Group and has started operating as an autonomous unit within the Group since beginning of the year to realise its new remit and ambition. At the heart of this transformation is NCS NEXT, a separate service organisation created to drive the company’s new focus on digital, cloud and platform services. NEXT will complement NCS’ other core service offerings in applications, infrastructure, engineering and cyber security, and provide a differentiated and comprehensive suite of end-to-end technology services. NCS intends to hire up to 2,000 tech talent over the next two years. The past year has seen NEXT achieve key milestones, such as the launch of NEXT Shenzhen Innovation Centre; acquisition of 2359 Media, a Singapore-based mobile app digital consultancy; and the integration of DataSpark, Singtel’s analytics unit which offers unique big data and mobility intelligence services in Singapore and Australia. NCS also recently partnered C3 AI, a leader in enterprise artificial intelligence (AI) from the US, to take enterprise AI solutions to Asia Pacific. Given its proven strengths and track record of success in servicing the Singapore public sector, NCS will double down and scale this business segment with the creation of Gov+. This strategic business group will focus on building NCS’ digital government portfolio and strengthen its position as the leading digital catalyst for governments and smart cities across the Asia Pacific. A second strategic business group, Telco+, is a joint initiative between Singtel and NCS to help telecom companies transform digitally. The goal is to help telcos improve operational efficiencies and leverage data driven insights to deliver enhanced customer experiences. With the combined 5G capabilities of the Singtel Group and NCS’ expertise in digital and technology services, Telco+ will also develop a full stack of 5G-enabled solutions to help enterprises capitalise on the applications of 5G. Kuo Pin says, “The ‘plus’ in Gov+ and Telco+ signifies our intent to double down on the government and telco sectors, leveraging our expertise in servicing the public sector and the right to play in the Telco sector as part of the Singtel Group. We are committed to work even more closely with government agencies and will invest in building deep digital government capabilities to support their digital and innovation needs. Similarly, working off synergies with the Singtel Group, we stand ready to help telcos digitalise their operations so that they can go to market competitively and innovatively.” As part of its plans to expedite expansion into the enterprise sector, NCS has identified industries to focus on: Healthcare, Transportation, Financial Services, Industrial, Commercial, Communications, Media and Technology. Its expansion into Asia Pacific will be targeted, focusing on the high-growth markets of Singapore, Australia and Greater China. In December 2020, NCS launched NEXT in Australia in partnership with Optus Enterprise to deliver end-to-end ICT and digital services to the Australian enterprise market. Australia, which is Asia Pacific’s third-largest IT services market, provides access to a diversity of talent and technology. NCS aims to expand its presence in Australia through a combination of organic and inorganic means, building up digital capabilities in cloud and AI. In Greater China, which comprises both the mainland China and Hong Kong markets, NCS will concentrate on growing the enterprise business in the Healthcare, Transportation, Financial Services, Communications, Media, Technology and Manufacturing industries; while building digital capabilities in 5G, digital twin and blockchain. Kuo Pin shares, “For NCS to play well in the bigger league of technology services firms in Asia Pacific, we must be committed to grow our people, our diversity of talent, and offer them exciting and rewarding careers and opportunities. We have launched a people transformation programme surrounding culture, skill specialisation and becoming a learning organisation. This is a top priority for us.” Based on individual preference, performance and aptitude, tech professionals in NCS will have opportunities to move across specialisations, working in different regions and industries, and with different clients and partners to gain a wide range of experiences. NCS also plans to launch an immersive learning academy and platform - NCS Dojo - within the year, a place where the 10,000-strong NCS team can come together to share knowledge from real world projects through an apprentice-style practice-based approach. NCS’ transformation plan was unveiled today alongside a new brand identity and campaign, capturing its new purpose - to advance communities by partnering with governments and enterprises to harness technology and bringing people together to make the extraordinary happen. The symbol of two forward slashes in the new logo, which NCS labels as the ‘N power’ mark, represents NCS as a technology services firm and the double forward slashes used in internet URLs and in-line comments in computer programming, signify how deeply anchored NCS is in technology and its intention to leverage technology to champion transformation for governments and enterprises.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:   – NCS today announced the launch of NCS NEXT Cloud Centre of Excellence (CoE) in Melbourne. The CoE will offer governments and enterprises greater support on accelerating their cloud initiatives. This is part of NCS’ regional expansion strategy into Australia, following the partnership with Optus Enterprise in December 2020 to bring integrated ICT and digital services to Australian clients across a wide range of industries and government sectors. The CoE will also facilitate expertise exchange and deepen collaboration between Singapore and Australia, helping both cities build up cloud expertise in a competitive talent market. The setup of the CoE follows an earlier announcement made this year on the formation of NCS NEXT to help organisations leverage digital technologies to transform the way they operate. This would involve innovating and co-creating new applications, processes, and services with organisations to better service their end customers or stakeholders. NCS NEXT (CoE) in Melbourne is part of the company’s NEXT Innovation Triangle which also includes nodes in Singapore and Shenzhen and draws on the unique strengths each city brings in terms of talent, clients, and innovation. , said, “We have witnessed the increasing pace at which both public and commercial sectors in Australia are adopting a digital-first approach to transforming the way in which we live and work. Through the NCS NEXT Cloud CoE launch in Australia, Optus Enterprise and NCS can help Australian enterprises and government agencies leverage cloud-based innovations to unlock competitive advantages and enhance customer or citizen experiences. By tapping into NCS’ 40 years of experience in supporting the public sector in APAC and our strong partner ecosystem, NCS Australia will play an active role in nurturing and pushing the local ICT space forwards”.   A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was also signed today at the Cloud CoE launch, with The State Government of Victoria represented by Invest Victoria as well as the Department of Treasury and Finance. This partnership leverages the CoE to promote innovation in cloud, reach new customers, drive talent development, and advance Victoria’s competitiveness in the technology sector. With 80 per cent of Australian enterprises expected to shift to cloud-centric infrastructures and applications by the end of 2021, the launch of NCS NEXT Cloud CoE comes at an opportune time to help Australian organisations navigate the complex tech ecosystem and accelerate their cloud deployment.    said, “Victoria is the tech capital of Australia and we’re so proud to welcome NCS to Melbourne, creating jobs and continuing our thriving reputation of innovation and excellence.” To support the growth of the Cloud business in Australia, NCS is also committed to building the digital talent pool in Victoria, focusing on capabilities in innovation, artificial intelligence, 5G-enabled internet of things (IoT) applications, advanced analytics and cloud. NCS aims to grow the local team to 1,500 and create 500 new digital skilled jobs over the next few years to support the needs and aspirations of the Victorian and national ICT communities.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  The Land Transport Authority (LTA) will be replacing the existing electronic road pricing (ERP) system with the next-generation (nexgen) ERP system that supports Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) technology. Central to the new system is a new vehicle on-board unit (OBU) which can provide value-added services for motorists, such as advance alerts on charging locations and real-time traffic information. However, the supply of essential microchips, which is required for the OBUs, has been affected by the worsening global shortage of microchips, a situation that is also impacting many other industries. To ensure a smooth and uninterrupted installation exercise for all motorists, the installation of OBUs is now planned to commence in the second half of 2023, instead of end-2021. 2          The COVID-19 pandemic has boosted global demand for microchips while affecting their production, following the suspension of operations in major semiconductor foundries across multiple countries. This has severely impacted the production of electronic devices across multiple sectors, from consumer electronics to industrial machines and automotive. 3          The production of the OBU has been similarly affected. Its parts need to be sourced from different suppliers and a few have indicated that they have been unable to meet the required delivery schedules for critical components. This shortage is expected to persist through 2022 and the recovery in microchip production is expected to be gradual, from end-2022 to mid-2023. Given the uncertainty in the supply chain and in order for installation to commence only when OBU production is stable and sufficient, the OBU installation exercise is now planned to commence in the second half of 2023. 4          The first OBU will be installed free of charge for existing Singapore-registered vehicles. LTA will monitor the impact of COVID-19 on the OBU installation timeline, and the current ERP system will continue to operate until the nexgen ERP is implemented. 5          LTA is working closely with its contractors NCS Pte Ltd (NCS) and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Asia Pacific Pte Ltd (MHI) to commence OBU production and prepare for the OBU installation. 6          Mr Ng Kuo Pin, CEO of NCS, said: “We will continue to work closely with our longstanding partners LTA and MHI, leveraging our combined capabilities to manage the challenges from the global microchip shortage. We will also continue with our rigorous testing on all systems and processes to support mass installation in 2023.” 7          Mr Naoaki Ikeda, President of MHI Machinery Systems, the group company of MHI involved in the OBU production, said: “We remain committed to commencing OBU production as soon as possible, and are working closely with our supply chain partners to source for the affected components and safeguard their availability for the installation exercise.” 8          Mr Ng Lang, CEO of LTA, said: “We would like to seek motorists’ understanding as we work closely with our partners to resolve the production challenges brought on by COVID-19. Our priority is to ensure that the installation exercise proceeds smoothly. We will give ample notice to motorists and motor vehicle industry ahead of the installation exercise.” The Land Transport Authority awarded the contract for developing the nexgen ERP system to the consortium of NCS Pte Ltd & Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Asia Pacific Pte Ltd in 2016. The nexgen ERP will be a technological refresh of the current physical gantry-based ERP system, which was introduced more than 20 years ago in 1998 and is increasingly more expensive to maintain. Leveraging Global Navigation Satellite System, the new system will be a more feature-rich system, going beyond congestion charging to also improve traffic management and transport planning and provide value-added services for motorists, such as advance notifications on charging locations and real-time traffic information.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:   – NCS today announced its acquisition of fast-growing digital services firm ARQ Group (ARQ) in Australia for A$290 million. The move brings to scale NCS NEXT in Australia, which now offers a compelling end-to-end digital transformation value proposition for clients. Headquartered in Melbourne, with offices in Sydney and Brisbane, ARQ has deep expertise in cloud, digital, data and analytics solutions, and is one of the fastest-growing digital services company in Australia. ARQ’s revenue is projected to reach A$118M by end 2022 representing a year-on-year increase of 38%, while EBITDA is projected to increase to A$18.4M. The acquisition price represents an EV/EBITDA multiple of 15.7 times , reflecting NCS’ confidence in the prospects of ARQ and expected synergies with the rest of its operations. This investment is NCS’ fourth in Australia in the past 15 months as it expands its footprint in a market strategic to its regionalisation plans. NCS recently acquired Australia’s largest privately-owned IT services company, The Dialog Group (Dialog) following 2 previous investments: cloud consultancy Riley that specialises in Google cloud applications and a majority investment in cloud transformation specialist Eighty20 Solutions that has unique capabilities across Microsoft platforms. , said, “This latest acquisition completes a jigsaw of strategic investments in Australia, ramping up our presence in a market that is critical to our regional expansion. Combined with Dialog’s core IT capabilities and extensive reach across 8 Australian cities, ARQ brings on board the right digital competencies that help create a highly compelling end-to-end digital transformation value proposition. Taken together, our four investments to date have given us the necessary scale, capabilities and credibility to compete as a regional digital powerhouse as we help governments and enterprises in Singapore and Australia achieve their digital transformation goals.” As one of the largest fast-growing digital services providers in Australia, ARQ has a strong client coverage and serves half of ASX’s top 20 companies across diverse sectors in financial services, utilities, retail, healthcare, travel and government. This includes ANZ bank, AustralianSuper, Domino’s, Qantas, Transurban, nib, NAB, The Coffee Club, NSW Rural Fire Services, Queensland Government – Department of Education, Victoria State Government – Department of Transport, and more. ARQ has a strong partnership ecosystem across major cloud hyperscalers in Australia and its expertise in delivering tailored tech innovation at scale through its 560-strong team will bolster NCS NEXT capabilities in digital, cloud, data and platforms to fulfill growing digital transformation demand in Australia’s large addressable market. IDC expects that Digital services in APAC will grow at a CAGR of 14.6% from 2020 to 2025, reaching US$170.6 billion in 2025. In Australia, Digital services are expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.7% from 2020 to 2025 to US$12.1 billion in 2025. , said, “Joining the NCS family is a tremendous opportunity to continue growing the business as it now allows us to go international and serve regional clients besides capturing more domestic market share by leveraging synergies within NCS. We are well primed for expansion, having grown our government footprint to over a third of our business, acquired many new customers and hired 300 new talents on board. We intend to keep optimising NCS’ world-class IT and digital capabilities to keep building innovative solutions for our clients.” As part of its transformational growth plan, NCS has been scaling its presence in Australia since December 2020 to serve Australian clients through NCS NEXT, its digital innovation and services arm - which supports enterprises’ growing demand for digital transformation solutions. , said, “We look forward to welcoming ARQ into the NCS NEXT family. ARQ’s highly experienced and scalable agile teams will become part of NEXT as one regional digital team to serve clients across the region in the post-pandemic era. Together, we will unlock more synergies between Australia and Singapore and enable cross-pollination of tech innovation.” ARQ’s 560-strong team will increase NCS’ headcount in Australia to 1,900 and build a robust tech talent pipeline to support the growing digital transformation needs of clients in the region. With increased workforce mobility, employees and future talents will be able to explore diverse and exciting career opportunities across various geographies and industries to serve clients through a hybrid delivery model. ARQ embraces a strong people culture and its talents adopt an innovation-first mindset to design and develop solutions – evident in their 572 technical certifications, 62 design awards and 17 certified partnerships. NCS’ focus on an apprenticeship-based learning culture is similar to ARQ Academy’s emphasis on self-learning and innovation, and the combination of both teams will reinvent talent development and answers the tech talent crunch in both Australia and Singapore. The acquisition is subject to the receipt of the relevant regulatory approvals and is expected to complete by May 2022.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  – Leading technology services firm NCS has launched a suite of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and digital resilience (DR) solutions for organisations looking to re-invent themselves in the AI era. These include frameworks, solutions and accelerators that governments and enterprises in Asia Pacific (APAC) can easily tap to use AI securely and at scale to drive sustainable game-changing innovation.  The launch took place at its annual Impact forum yesterday where NCS CEO, Ng Kuo Pin, addressed over 1,000 leaders and technology practitioners from the region, and shared NCS’ AI-led plans for changing the game. He highlighted two key success factors for organisations – AI adoption and digital resilience – to fully harness the benefits of technology in a world redefined by economic uncertainty, geopolitical tensions and technological challenges.   said, “Across the world, AI is top of mind now, but organisations must not overlook the importance of digital resilience as they embrace AI’s transformational potential. To build a safer and more sustainable future, it is crucial that organisations invest to build a foundation in cybersecurity, data governance and technology that will allow AI to flourish. We believe organisations that master both AI and digital resilience will be the ones that will thrive in this increasingly complex global environment.” NCS’ new suite of solutions include the   which enables organisations to build a strategic roadmap that enhances both AI and digital resilience concurrently. Serving as an essential starting point for any organisation embarking on its AI journey, the innovative framework categorises organisations into four quadrants of AI Dust, Missed Opportunity, House of Cards, and Game Changer (see Figure 1), based on their maturity levels of AI adoption and digital resilience. This allows organisations to assess their AI and digital resilience readiness and calibrate key developmental steps as they move down the AI pathway.  , “AI will be a game changer and companies must learn the new game – the earlier, the better. Given the speed at which AI evolves and the implications of AI for businesses, working with the right technology partners to help navigate the AI landscape and plug into the right ecosystem is fundamental. Having primed our workforce for the intelligence revolution, NCS is AI-ready and well-positioned to help organisations avoid the pitfalls of AI adoption while unlocking its game-changing value. We will lead with AI inside and outside.” 
 NCS also introduced  , a solution for organisations to assess their digital resilience across five key areas –  . Leveraging NCS’ expertise in large-scale implementations and operations, Polaris DR will enable them to lay the strong foundation needed for enterprise-wide growth and AI adoption by providing a customised improvement plan to address vulnerabilities in systems, technology infrastructure and IT operations. To empower clients to deploy AI more securely and efficiently, NCS announced five innovative and repeatable  embedded with NCS AI Accelerators. The solutions are both standardised and customisable, enabling organisations to accelerate AI deployments in three key areas –  – while ensuring consistency and scalability. The solutions not only leverage NCS’ track record in partnering governments and enterprises on their technology journeys, it also taps NCS’ deep industry knowledge and methodologies honed over time, regional AI talent pool, and extensive partnerships with global players in AI technology. NCS announced several strategic partnerships with industry leaders to further facilitate AI adoption and digital resilience. NCS is partnering   to launch its   with AWS’s Generative AI Innovation Centre (GAIIC) . Customised for the APAC public sector, the CoE will leverage AWS’s team of strategists, applied scientists, engineers, and solutions architects through the GAIIC’s Partner Innovation Alliance programme to envision, scope, and accelerate public sector solutions using AWS. The collaboration combines NCS’ end-to-end capabilities and industry experience with AWS’s Generative AI services and global expertise.  “We’re excited to collaborate with NCS to establish its inaugural CoE for Public Good that will accelerate the delivery of innovative citizen services. At AWS, we help customers move Generative AI from theory into practice by providing purpose-built services and expert guidance. Through this collaboration, we’ll empower NCS to bring Generative AI workloads to life and help public sector agencies drive impactful outcomes for the people they serve.” NCS is collaborating with  to leverage Dell AI Factory with NVIDIA, as an to further accelerate adoption of Generative AI solutions by enterprises in the region. With their combined expertise in Generative AI and breadth of industry experience, NCS and Dell are committed to simplifying clients’ AI adoption journeys and enhancing proof of concept efforts. This collaboration allows clients to explore customised and pre-validated solutions to turbocharge their Generative AI projects in a modular manner. 
 As NCS becomes intelligence-led, the company has been infusing AI across the organisation and building a pipeline of future AI talent. It has equipped its 13,000-strong workforce located across APAC with AI-powered services and solutions to enhance productivity and transform how NCS operates and delivers its services. NCS will also create a 3,000-strong AI-certified practitioner base to accelerate implementation and deployment of clients’ AI projects.

                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:   - In an era where AI is becoming fundamental to drive transformation, NCS today announced a S$130 million investment over three years to lead change across Asia Pacific (APAC).  At its annual flagship Impact Forum, attended by more than 1,200 leaders and technology practitioners from APAC, NCS outlined a vision where technology transcends borders, best practices are shared across diverse markets, and AI serves to advance communities rather than replace human capability.  NCS launched Sunshine.AI, a suite of AI tools and accelerators that transform how organisations develop intelligent solutions. NCS also announced strategic partnerships with leading global technology players and strengthened collaboration with research institutions, building a dynamic community of AI practitioners that elevates NCS’ AI capabilities and regional leadership.  "With AI reshaping industries as it becomes more accessible than before, we’re partnering government agencies and enterprises to help them harness the best of AI not just for efficiency gains but to advance communities,” said NCS CEO Ng Kuo Pin. “Expanding our APAC footprint and doubling down on collaborations with technology leaders are still important in a bifurcated world. The investment we are making over the next three years and our blueprint anchored by three pillars – Intelligentisation, Internationalisation and Inspiration – will better enable our people and clients to create new business outcomes and build a resilient, innovative future with AI,” he added. 
  Intelligentisation is a structured, holistic approach to embedding intelligence into the core of business processes, government workflows, and human experiences. This means designing AI systems not as standalone tools, but as integral components of decision-making, service delivery and operational flow. Central to this are NCS-proprietary tools, accelerators and methodologies.  From assessment to design to implementation, the NCS Sunshine suite of tools is tailored for developers, IT operations teams and corporate users. It comprises:  NCS’ accelerators comprise proprietary frameworks, code libraries, and deployment toolkits that mirror human cognitive functions like perception, reasoning, decision-making, and action.  This approach recognises that AI can only be as strong as a system’s digital resilience, which covers Cybersecurity, Data Backbone, Applications Interplay, Infrastructure Robustness and Operations Responsiveness. These factors ensure organisations possess the attributes necessary for sustained AI adoption.  As an example of this focus, NCS has signed a five-year Master Agreement with Singapore’s HTX to architect HTX’s foundational data core, embed intelligence such as Agentic AI into systems, adopt quantum-safe technologies, and scale robotics solutions. The collaboration will integrate and streamline data across Home Team agencies and embed next-generation intelligence into systems to enhance operational effectiveness.  In addition, Singtel Group is partnering with NCS to embed AI as a core capability across its business, using AI as a strategic driver. As Singtel’s AI-implementation arm, NCS will build solutions leveraging its comprehensive portfolio of tools, including its Sunshine.AI suite as well as Gen AI and Agentic AI assets and accelerators. Singtel and NCS will collaborate to identify, shape and realise high-impact opportunities, using AI to transform operations, customer experience and strengthen its data, AI and cloud infrastructure. This includes optimising customer value management through personalisation, streamlining processes, and building autonomous networks – all built on a foundation that enables scalable AI adoption.  "Intelligentisation means treating AI as part of the enterprise's core nervous system, engineered with the same rigour, trust, and responsiveness demanded of mission-critical infrastructure," explained Kuo Pin. 
  As the global AI landscape fragments across technology stacks, governance models and digital ecosystems, cross-border collaboration and strong technology partners matter more than ever in delivering strong value for clients.  : In March, NCS announced a Joint Venture with the Philippines' Globe Telecom to take a majority stake in its technology services arm Yondu. This will add 1,200 technology professionals to the NCS workforce while scaling its capabilities in Agentic AI, Data Foundation, and Data Management services. They will complement the existing 13,000-strong NCS workforce across Singapore, Australia, Greater China, India and Southeast Asia, enabling NCS to better serve its clients. Globe Telecom and NCS are also co-developing telco-centric solutions addressing unique telecommunications transformation challenges across the region.  : In addition, six strategic partnerships announced at Impact demonstrate how collaboration amplifies innovation across fragmented AI landscapes.  As AI advances, public concerns about job displacement and loss of control can also rise. Yet this presents an opportunity to design AI that augments human capability rather than replacing it, keeping humans in the centre. Inspiration is more than a theme. It is a call to business leaders to apply this powerful technology to advance communities; where people and AI evolve together, not apart.  : NCS actively shapes Singapore's broader AI landscape through collaborative initiatives that prioritise cultural relevance and ethical development. As a key industry partner to AISG's SEA-LION, the company helps refine language models for Southeast Asian contexts while applying them within enterprise operations. As a founding member of the MERaLiON Consortium, NCS advances conversational AI use cases reflecting regional languages and operational context – from next-generation contact centres to enterprise productivity assistants.  NCS also contributes to the Infocomm Media Development Authority's AI Verify Foundation, demonstrating its commitment to establishing internationally recognised standards for AI reliability, safety, fairness and robustness; and helping define how AI systems can be measured and trusted at scale. : More than 10,000 NCS employees have achieved AI enablement through comprehensive training, industry certifications, and practical implementation experience. This includes over 1,000 professionals certified across major cloud platforms including AWS, Google, Microsoft and NVIDIA – creating an AI-enabled workforce capable of guiding clients through complex transformations.  "Intelligentisation is how we harness AI, Internationalisation is who we work with, and Inspiration is why we do this — to advance communities," said Kuo Pin. "This is central to NCS' purpose. We partner with governments and enterprises to harness the best of AI not just for efficiency gains, but to uplift people and advance communities."

  I have always enjoyed tackling challenges and finding innovative ways to improve processes, which naturally led me to a career in tech. The ever-evolving nature of technology excites me, as it offers endless opportunities for learning, career growth, and contributing to meaningful advancements. Each challenge I overcome and each new skill I acquire helps me progress, reinforcing my passion for this field.  Additionally, my mother played a significant role in shaping my outlook. She was a teacher who single-handedly took care of us after my father passed away. She always showed me that women must be independent, resilient, and capable of achieving their goals. Her strength and determination continue to inspire me to push boundaries and make a meaningful impact in the tech industry. 
  One of the biggest challenges I faced was returning to work when my newborn was just three months old. Balancing the demands of a career while caring for an infant was incredibly difficult, both emotionally and physically. However, I pushed through because I was determined not to give up on my career. Looking back, I am proud that I persevered, and it means even more to me knowing that I am setting an example for my daughter - that women can be strong, independent, and successful in both their personal and professional lives. 
  One of my most exciting career projects was designing and implementing automation solutions that streamlined cloud infrastructure deployment and optimised software delivery pipelines. By automating complex manual processes, I helped improve efficiency, reduce errors, and enhance system security.  A key highlight was working for one of the Big 4 banks, where I designed and implemented an automation solution that significantly reduced rework and saved time. This solution was so effective that it is still being reused by the platform team, reinforcing the long-term impact of well-designed automation in improving operational efficiency. Seeing my work continue to benefit the team has been incredibly rewarding. 
  Solving complex challenges and seeing the impact of my work motivates me the most. I enjoy building solutions that improve system performance, security, and reliability. Additionally, collaborating with teams, sharing knowledge, and learning new technologies keeps me engaged and inspired. 
  Believe in your abilities, stay curious, and never stop learning. The tech industry is constantly evolving, so being adaptable and open to new challenges is key. Seek out mentors, build a strong support network, and don’t hesitate to take on opportunities that push you out of your comfort zone. Your voice and contributions matter, and diversity in tech leads to stronger, more innovative solutions.

             You can drop us a call or email Deepti Bansal | Senior Test Manager  Deepti Bansal is a Senior Test Manager at NCS Australia, and an integral part of our team that delivers   nationally. In this profile, she shares more about how curiosity and a love for problem solving have shaped her career, and her passion for building and leading high-performing teams. 
  I come from a time in India when most parents dreamt of their children becoming either an engineer or a doctor, and my parents were no exception. Since I was good in maths and physics, I was encouraged to pursue engineering. Naturally curious and passionate about problem-solving, I embraced the journey in technology studies. Though I wasn't fully aware of the vast opportunities in the tech world until I joined my engineering college.  Initially, my primary motivation during my bachelor in engineering degree was to secure a good job with a strong organisation and make my parents proud that their daughter is finally an engineer. However, as I progressed in my studies, I realized the true potential of what I could achieve through technology.  My biggest inspiration was my mother, who strongly influenced my decision to pursue engineering. She always wanted her daughters to stand out in society as respected and independent women, and that belief continues to drive me till today. 
  After working as Test manager for 18 years in the Telecom industry, I stepped into a new domain – Health Insurance – for the first time. Adapting to this industry was a significant learning curve in itself, and on top of that, I was assigned a critical transformation project. The project involved migrating from a legacy system to a new cloud-based technology offered by Oracle and EY. This transformation was highly challenging, both in terms of delivery expectations and team attrition.  To navigate these challenges, I redesigned test strategies, identified risks and mitigation plans, and worked towards building a high-performing team. One of the key aspects was restoring client trust and confidence in a team that had been struggling with high attrition due to instability and a lack of clarity.  Revitalizing the project – turning it from a struggling effort into a high-speed, efficient transformation – was a thrilling experience. Not only did I grow professionally through this journey, but the client’s trust was restored, and the team developed a stronger sense of belonging and felt valued, which was incredibly fulfilling. 
  As a Programme Test Manager, I am motivated by the challenge of building and leading high-performing teams that drive quality and efficiency in software delivery. Having established a strong team, I take pride in developing and executing test strategies that align with business objectives. My role allows me to ensure seamless collaboration, optimize testing processes, and mitigate risks, ultimately enabling the organisation to deliver high-quality solutions with confidence. Seeing the direct impact of my work – where testing is not just a checkpoint but a strategic enabler of innovation by finding gaps/bugs in process and products, fuels my passion for continuous improvement and excellence in software quality. 
  Never be afraid to embrace growth or leadership roles – nothing comes without challenges. Learn to push through obstacles; this may require working harder, seeking guidance from a mentor, and continuously improving your skills in the ever-evolving tech world. Perseverance is crucial.  Be bold and confident in sharing your ideas, and develop the ability to balance work and life by choosing your priorities wisely. Resilience is key to growth.  Lastly, maintain strong work ethics and find ways to give back, whether through mentoring others or contributing to your community. Establish strong communication skills. Share this article on: NCS Australia is a place our team feel at home nurturing their talents and skills, as we make tomorrow together, one day at a time.

                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Natasha Lee | Executive Assistant  Natasha ‘Tash’ Lee is an integral part of NCS Australia’s Business Enablement team, providing vital support that adds value across the business. But she also strives to go over and above – whether it’s by coordinating internal events, advocating for women in their careers, or supporting with NCS’ diversity, equity and inclusion activities to support more inclusive, connected workplaces across our offices around Australia.  She shares her career profile, including more about what she finds inspiring, challenges she’s overcome and what motivates her professionally. 
  Initially, I didn’t feel that I was actively pursuing a career in tech – I was drawn more to the dynamic work environment and the opportunity to collaborate with innovative leaders. However, after working closely with my CEO and his team for less than six months, I was completely hooked. Seeing firsthand how technology drives transformation, problem-solving, and meaningful change ignited my passion for the industry. The fast-paced, ever-evolving nature of tech, combined with the opportunity to contribute to impactful initiatives, made me realise this was exactly where I wanted to be. 
  One of the biggest challenges I’ve faced is transitioning into the tech industry without a traditional tech background. My career started in warehousing and logistics – if you needed to route a route or complete a risk assessment, I was your woman. Stepping into tech meant learning an entirely new industry, new terminology, and new ways of thinking. It’s been a continuous learning curve, but I’ve embraced every opportunity to grow, ask questions, and build my knowledge. I’m still learning, and that’s what makes it exciting.  Another major challenge has been ensuring that diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) are seen as business priorities. This has required persistence, data-driven insights, and demonstrating the tangible business benefits of inclusivity. Through strategic planning and collaboration, I’ve been able to embed DEI into the broader company strategy, making it a core focus rather than an afterthought. 
  One of the most exciting moments in my career was being made a key stakeholder in DEI events at NCS Australia. Having the opportunity to lead and shape initiatives that drive real change in diversity, equity, and inclusion has been incredibly fulfilling.   Additionally, being part of the Global Innovation team has been an exciting and dynamic experience. Collaborating on forward-thinking projects, contributing to strategic initiatives, and working with brilliant minds across different regions has broadened my perspective and deepened my passion for innovation and continuous improvement.  Both roles have allowed me to not only make an impact but also grow as a leader, problem solver, and advocate for meaningful change. 
  What truly motivates me is seeing everything that we work on in the 'background' come to life. I’ve always felt that I play a behind-the-scenes role, ensuring that things run smoothly and that the right people, projects, and initiatives are set up for success. Watching those efforts translate into meaningful outcomes – whether it's a successful event, a well-executed strategy, or a positive shift in culture – makes all the hard work worthwhile. Knowing that my contributions help create a more inclusive, efficient, and engaged workplace drives me to keep pushing for improvement and innovation every day. 
  Go for it! If you have a passion for tech, don’t hesitate. The tech industry is filled with incredible opportunities, and the community – especially women in tech – is one of the most supportive I’ve ever experienced. There’s mentorship, guidance, and endless ways to grow.  Get involved in online groups and networks – LinkedIn is a great place to start. There are so many communities dedicated to women in tech where you can connect, learn, and be inspired. Surround yourself with people who uplift you and never be afraid to take up space and make your mark.  Believe in the value you bring and the unique perspective you offer. The tech industry thrives on innovation, and diverse voices are essential to its success. Find mentors, build a strong support system, and advocate for yourself and others. Most importantly, step into new opportunities with confidence – even if you don’t feel 100% ready. Growth happens outside of your comfort zone (I’ve experienced this firsthand), and the most rewarding moments often come from taking that leap.

I grew up as the youngest in a family of 9 and it was a busy household, but my dad placed a huge focus on education and he strived for equal opportunities for his daughters. He was ahead of his time in supporting girls in STEM. He would focus on helping my sisters and I excel in maths, science and tech.  I spent weekends playing with circuit boards, soldering irons, robotic experiments and early PCs. While my dad wasn’t an artist in the traditional sense, his ability to create things with tech fascinated me. I became passionate about building things and problem-solving,  leading me to explore user experience design, programming, and multimedia. Eventually, I found my calling in project management. 
  What challenges have you faced and overcome? 
 
My calling to project management didn't come straight away. I knew I belonged in IT, but I was drawn to so many areas. I loved working in UX, BA and dev roles.  The challenged I faced was working out what craft I really wanted to hone, and through time and experience, that proved to be Project Management. The other challenge was then being taken seriously as a young woman in IT Project Management, leading teams of much older and experienced tech professionals. I think this challenge was overcome by showing respect, and proving myself through actions not words. 
  One of my proudest achievements has been leading the design and development of a bespoke healthcare quality management product, which has seen continued success in the Australian market for over 15 years. There's nothing like creating a completely new solution or product and seeing it grow!  Another career highlight was leading the user experience design and front-end engineering for the NSW Roads and Maritime Services online customer portal. It was an exciting project due to the scale of the target audience and the opportunity to work with new tools and techniques. 
  My biggest motivation is my team. I’m fortunate to work alongside a talented group of project managers, each highly skilled in our discipline. Collaborating to achieve outstanding results for our customers and NCS is incredibly rewarding. I strive to be someone they can rely on – a servant leader offering support in their daily work and fostering their professional growth. 
  We need more women in tech to help ensure our solutions reflect and consider the diverse communities they serve. While honing your professional skills is essential in IT, it’s just as important to find a team where you are valued and your voice is heard. Advocate for yourself and don't be shy. You will need a thick skin and for some of us it takes time to build that up.  Finding an inclusive, supportive network can make all the difference.

             You can drop us a call or email Georgia Swanson | Director of Strategy and Growth, NCS NEXT, Global Innovation  Mentoring and supporting others is part of what inspires Georgia Swanson, our Director of Strategy and Growth in our NCS Next, Global Innovation team at NCS. Georgia gets to work closely with our Chief Scientist’s office regionally in her role, a fun aspect of which is storytelling some of NCS’ innovative work with AI and tech that enables businesses and organisations to be set up for success today and for the day after tomorrow. 
  I’ve always thrived in environments that challenge me - where there’s an opportunity to push boundaries, solve complex problems, and achieve something groundbreaking.   As an ex-athlete, I was constantly striving to improve, to refine my skills, and to push past limits. That drive for achievement, for taking on something that feels impossible and making it possible, has followed me into my career in tech. Technology is one of the few industries where you are continuously learning, adapting, and innovating. It’s never stagnant - there’s always a new challenge to take on, whether it’s leveraging emerging technologies to solve real world business problems or rethinking how organisations operate in a digital first world. The problem solving aspect of tech excites me. I love being in an industry that forces me to think critically, to experiment.   Beyond the personal challenge, what inspires me most is the ability to create meaningful change. Technology has the power to transform businesses, industries, and even people’s lives. Being part of that transformation, helping to drive innovation that makes a tangible impact, is what keeps me motivated every day. 
  There have been many challenges, but one of the biggest was starting out as a woman in male dominated industries without a mentor to guide me. Early in my career, I found myself in environments where I was often the youngest in the room, the only woman at the table, and, in many cases, underestimated. I had to figure things out on my own - how to navigate corporate structures, how to advocate for myself, and how to ensure that my voice was heard.  At times, I faced situations where my inexperience was exploited, where I wasn’t given the same respect or opportunities as others. Without a mentor or role model to look up to, I learned through trial and error. I had to build my own resilience, trust my instincts, and develop a strong sense of self belief. Those experiences shaped me, but they also highlighted how important it is to have women in leadership who actively support and uplift the next generation.  That’s why mentorship is something I prioritise today. I want to be the role model I didn’t have, the person who makes sure young women in tech don’t have to figure it all out alone. I want to create spaces where they feel heard, valued, and empowered to take on leadership roles without having to fight for a seat at the table. If I can make someone else’s journey just a little bit easier, then that’s a challenge I’m proud to have turned into a purpose. 
  One of the most exhilarating projects I’ve worked on was the launch of NCS Next a few years ago - an event that simultaneously took place across Singapore, Australia, and the metaverse. It was an incredibly ambitious vision, executed under extreme time pressure, but it’s exactly the kind of challenge I thrive on.  We took over The LUME in Melbourne, an immersive digital art space, and worked with 152 unique digital screens to create an experience that was fully immersive, synchronised, and broadcast live across multiple locations. Every detail had to be carefully planned to ensure that the in person experiences across different regions and the metaverse activation all felt cohesive and seamless.  And we did it - all within less than two months. It was a high-pressure, high-stakes project, but the energy, creativity, and collaboration that went into it made it one of the most rewarding experiences of my career. Seeing it all come together - seeing the impact it had on the audience, the recognition it received, and the sheer scale of what we pulled off in such a short time = was an incredible moment. 
  I’m driven by the desire to create positive change - whether that’s through the impact of technology, the growth of the people I work with, or the transformation of businesses.  There’s nothing more rewarding than seeing people realise their potential - watching them push past their own doubts, solve problems they once thought were insurmountable, and come out the other side stronger. I love seeing individuals step into leadership, challenge themselves, and achieve things they didn’t think they could.  At the core of my motivation is a belief that challenges are opportunities for growth. Whether it’s helping a business navigate digital transformation, mentoring someone through a tough career moment, or solving a complex problem, I find energy in helping others rise to the occasion. At the end of the day, my motivation is about making an impact - on people, on businesses, and on the future of technology. 
  Don’t wait for permission, step forward and take up space. Tech is evolving rapidly, and there’s no single path to success. The best thing you can do is stay curious, keep learning, and actively seek out opportunities where you can showcase your skills.  Surround yourself with mentors and a strong network. I’ve learned so much from working with diverse teams and leaders who challenge me to think differently. Find those who support and uplift you, but also don’t be afraid to challenge the status quo when needed.  Finally, be bold in advocating for yourself and others. Tech is at its best when it’s inclusive and innovative, and that starts with having diverse perspectives in the room. Whether it’s through your projects, leadership, or mentorship, always look for ways to open doors for the next generation of women in tech.

                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Leanne Fernandes | Strategic Account Leader  During an exciting career, our Account Manager Leanne Fernandes has found her career in tech to be inspiring – including the directions she’s been able to take in directing and advancing herself professionally. She tells us more about her professional story, and what’s motivated her, in this career profile. 
  I didn’t plan a career in tech but kind of just landed in it. I had finished a Bachelor of Biological Science at Deakin University in Victoria and had no idea what to do with it. Most of my friends went on to further studies to be a High School Science teacher but this was not for me. I saw a job on the Uni job board and it was for a computer company as a manufacturing trainee. I applied, got the job and moved to Sydney in a whirlwind space of a month.   My first role was building computers on a production line and so my career began. Once you are in tech, it is amazing the directions you can go and I think what I love about it most is that you are constantly learning and there is always something that will grab your interest. It was the other manufacturing trainees that inspired me to continue in the tech industry. I watched them be promoted to roles in many different parts of the business and also in different cities across Australia. The opportunities were endless. 
  I have been in the tech industry for many years and have seen it go through peaks and troughs both in employment opportunities and then also changes in technology. Redundancies are common in every industry but the IT industry can be hit quite hard and I have weathered many periods where the company I have been working for has done mass redundancies.   I had always managed to retain my job, until Dec 2023 where I found myself redundant. While it wasn’t a big shock, it certainly wasn’t part of my career plan at that time and I really wasn’t sure what I wanted next. I took a couple of months to spend with my teenage children who were on school holidays and pursued some personal interests, before realising that I was missing the stimulation of working in tech.   There were a lot of jobs out there, so I had to really decide what type of company I wanted to work for, what role I wanted to do and what career prospects I wanted to be able to access within the next company that I worked for. I remember applying for the role at NCS and ticking most of the boxes both on their requirements and my requirements and was extremely fortunate to be successful in being offered a role. 
  This may not have been the most exciting but it certainly was the most rewarding and I wanted to talk about this one as it is a true example of technology directly helping individuals. The project was rolling out laptops to support high potential but socio-economically disadvantaged girls across Australia. The laptops, data access and managed IT support were part of a scholarship awarded to these girls providing them with the tools and resources that they needed to support them to reach their potential, complete high school and pursue a tertiary education. For some, access to technology is limited because they cannot afford a computer at home and this places them at a disadvantage to other students of their year level who do have easy access to technology.   The company I worked with at the time provided the technology and IT support to the girls. It was a humbling experience hearing some of the support requests come through for things that I took for granted having been exposed to IT devices, software and systems for most of my career. 
  I have a growth mindset and the tech industry allows me to constantly feed this need to always be growing – that is what motivates me every day at work. I love knowing that I am on the cutting-edge of technology and creating things that can change people’s lives for the better. I also love being around clever people and having stimulating conversations. It is exciting and every day is different. I have a very inquisitive mind so being in tech fulfils this need. 
  Don’t be put off by thinking a career in tech is for men and that being female will make it harder for you to succeed. Be yourself and know your strengths. Acknowledge that being female may highlight strengths that are not readily found in our male counterparts. Having diversity in a team or company brings better results as it generates more creativity and ideas to discuss.   The career paths in tech are diverse and wide-reaching. It is a growing industry so you will – hopefully – never be without a job, and it is one that pays well. In the right company with the right people, you will be well supported in achieving all that you desire.

  My inspiration has come from one of the senior female leaders I worked with many years ago.  At the time, technology was dominated by males, this was from sales roles to senior leadership.  My strengths were in account management and she gave me an opportunity to work in an IT sales support role.  This sparked my curiosity and made me realise that a career in tech could be both challenging and rewarding.  My career grew from here. 
  It has been challenging being a female in tech. It’s a male-dominated industry. Balancing work and motherhood in a fast-paced and ever-changing industry can be challenging too. I’ve overcome these challenges by building a strong network of mentors and peers and working with supportive teams.

             You can drop us a call or email Mollshree Gogia | Practice Principal, South Australia, Quality & Testing  Watching her dad – an engineer - approach challenges with logic, precision, and an unwavering belief that every problem had a solution – is a memory that’s stayed with Mollshree Gogia, a female leader at NCS in Australia who embraces the 'A' for Adventure in NCS’ values of AEIOU. Mollshree is continually curious and truly appreciates the strength that comes from bringing together stakeholders with different perspectives to get the best outcomes on projects. She considers the best results come from "collaboration, not conformity” and was recognised as a    for her commitment to customer success.  She shares more of her story in this profile. 
  For me, the journey into tech started with pure curiosity – an endless fascination with how things worked and a desire to make them work better. As a child, I loved puzzles and problem-solving, and was always eager to understand the mechanics behind everyday things. But the real turning point came from watching my father, an engineer, approach challenges with logic, precision, and an unwavering belief that every problem had a solution.   That mindset struck with me. When I pursued engineering, I found myself drawn to technology’s ability to transform ideas into reality. Testing and quality assurance, in particular, became my passion because they sit at the intersection of innovation and reliability. It’s not about making software work – it’s about making seamless, efficient, and valuable for the people who use it.   What inspires me today is the impact technology has on business and lives. Whether it’s streamlining services or helping teams build confidence in their systems, I love knowing that my work makes a tangible difference. And as technology continues to evolve, so does my excitement to explore, learn and help others navigate this ever-changing space. 
  Throughout my career, I’ve faced high pressure situation where projects were at risk – tight deadlines, missing stakeholders, and incomplete plans. Instead of seeking these as roadblocks, I’ve tackled them with strategic problem-solving, clear communication, and teamwork, turning challenges into success stories. Additionally, navigating traditionally male-dominated industry pushed me to prove my expertise and advocate for diverse voices. Today, I’m passionate about empowering teams, sharing knowledge, and fostering environments where diverse perspectives are valued – because the best solutions come from collaboration, not conformity. 
  I had the opportunity to work on Royal Adelaide Hospital project, from the build phase through to operations and maintenance. I managed multiple testing streams with various vendors and clients and each day was a unique experience. It was truly inspiring to witness how technology was transforming people’s daily lives, all while navigating complex testing demands across different stakeholders. 
  For me, motivation comes from impact – knowing that the work I do help businesses runs smoother, teams work efficiently, and customers have better experiences. I thrive on solving complex challenges, whether it’s turning a struggling project, improving quality processes or mentoring teams to reach their full potential.   Beyond the technical side, I love the human element of my work – collaborating with diverse teams, building strong client relationships, and driving solutions that make a real difference. Seeing a project go live successfully, a team gain confidence, or a client trust my expertise keeps me inspired every day.   And with technology constantly evolving, there’s always something to learn, improve, and innovate – which is exactly what keeps me excited about what I do! 
  My advice is simple: Go for it! The tech industry is full of exciting opportunities where your curiosity, creativity and problem-solving skills can truly shine. Don’t let doubts – whether they are your own or others' – hold you back.   Be confident in what you bring to the table, speak up, ask questions, and take on challenges that push you to grow. Surround yourself with supportive mentors and be sure to lift up other women along the way. Your voice and your perspective are exactly what this industry needs.  And remember, there’s no one-size-fits-all path in tech. Whether you are drawn to coding, design or testing, follow what excites you. There’s a world of possibilities waiting for you.

She was a   – recognised in the ‘Champion of Change’ category for her commitment to take action for widespread positive change and empowerment for women and other marginalised groups in tech. When she’s not busy leading training and development activities for NCS’ employees in Australia, Vandy is a passionate advocate for diversity, equity and inclusion across NCS offices and workplaces nationally. She strives to lead by example, and focuses on helping uplift others as well. She shares more about her passions and what drives her at work in this story. 
  My life purpose is to empower people to become the best versions of themselves. With the rapid advancements in technology, especially in AI, there are endless opportunities to assist and uplift others. Being part of this evolving field is incredibly exciting and aligns with my purpose, driving me forward on this path. 
  I see challenges as opportunities that unlock infinite possibilities. Though I’ve faced traditional mindsets and obstacles, I view them as stepping stones to breaking barriers. Embracing this mindset has empowered me to navigate and overcome numerous challenges throughout my life. And believe me, I’ve encountered my fair share of pushbacks, bias, and setbacks, but each one has only strengthened my resolve and determination. 
  One of the most exciting ‘projects’ for me has been the ongoing process of evolving to better understand and connect with people. It's incredibly rewarding to help solve problems, share insights, and support individuals in real-time – whether it's in tech, personal growth, or anything else that comes up. Every conversation feels like a new project, offering me the chance to learn, adapt, and become even more helpful. And that’s why I truly love what I do! 
  What motivates me is the opportunity to engage with people in meaningful ways, knowing that each interaction is a chance to make a positive impact. Whether it's providing solutions, sharing knowledge, or simply being a supportive presence, I thrive on the idea that I can reach and help so many people – making their day easier or more informed. Continuous learning and adapting also fuel my drive, pushing me to evolve and grow. 
  My advice for women wanting to pursue a career in tech is simple: Don’t let anyone limit your potential. Tech is for everyone, and there’s space for diverse perspectives and innovative ideas. Be curious, embrace learning, and take every opportunity to upskill, whether through formal education, online courses, or hands-on experience. Find mentors, seek out supportive networks, and build your confidence by taking on challenges – even if they seem daunting at first. And, most importantly, trust in your abilities and know that every setback is just an opportunity to grow stronger and smarter. You belong in tech, and your unique perspective is needed!

Along the way, a career in tech has happened naturally, and she’s embraced challenge and new opportunities.  Kavita, one of several women at NCS in Australia recognised as   – shares more about her personal story. 
  As a kid, I was that student - the one sketching elaborate costumes in history books, giving every historical figure a dramatic makeover just to make lessons more entertaining. I would cook up my own narratives around their lives, weaving stories around dates to help me remember them. Creativity and storytelling were always my thing. But I was also the kid with a million questions. My brothers used to tease me, saying I should just get a question mark tattooed. I come from a big family in India and I was the kid hanging out with the grandmas and grandpas because they always had the best stories to answer my never-ending curiosity. That love for asking ‘why’ and ‘what if’ eventually led me into design – because at its core, great design is about curiosity, understanding people, and solving problems. My dad would jokingly say – “she gets paid to ask questions.” My brother nudged me toward pursuing design, and tech just happened naturally – because the world was shifting from tangible design to digital experiences. For me, entering tech from product design wasn’t a leap; it was just the next adventure in a lifelong journey of creativity, curiosity, and problem-solving. 
  Oh, where do I start? Imposter syndrome? Check. Walking into rooms where I was the only woman? Check. Learning to own my voice and not wait for permission to speak? Double check. And then, of course, the battle of shifting the perception of design from “making things look pretty” to a critical business strategy. But beyond that, being an immigrant in tech has had its own set of challenges. Walking into client meetings where nobody looks or talks like me can be daunting. Sometimes, it takes extra effort to build credibility, find common ground, and be seen as a strategic leader rather than an outsider. But I’m slowly learning to own my space, let my work speak for itself, and most importantly - to lean into being ‘different’ rather than masking it. 
  I’ve been incredibly lucky to work with some of the biggest tech firms, including Facebook and Google - each project has left its own mark. But one of my most fascinating experiences was working in the discovery team for Instagram Stories. We were researching behavioural shifts in how people share their lives on social media, especially in regions like India, where societal norms influence online behaviour in unique ways. Our goal was to understand the psychology of sharing, the cultural nuances that shape content creation, and how privacy, self-expression, and validation play out on a platform like Instagram.  It was an eye-opening experience – seeing firsthand how social media isn’t just about technology, but deeply tied to human emotions, traditions, and evolving digital identities. This project, among others, shaped the way I think about design – going beyond the interface and truly designing for people, cultures, and the hidden forces that shape their behaviour. 
  I’m someone who thrives on intrinsic motivation –the need to push my own boundaries and challenge myself. That’s what keeps me excited, engaged, and constantly striving for more.  If you look at my career within NCS in the last 2 years - in just two years, I’ve taken on three different roles, starting as a Design Lead, pivoting into Sales, and now managing the Digital Experience practice. Every role has stretched me in new ways, and I love that. But beyond personal growth, my deeply meaningful relationships and mentors are a huge driving force. I’m surrounded by people who make me believe the world is my oyster - who inspire me to think bigger, dream bolder, and never settle.  I’m also an avid hiker, and that philosophy carries over into my work. Every challenge is like a mountain - you take it one step at a time, push past discomfort, and keep climbing. That mindset, along with my resilience, keeps me going, no matter how steep the path gets.

She’s also been put forward for awards herself – including as a finalist in the   (Delivery category) and the upcoming   , where she’s a finalist in a cohort of women that features some of the best in the industry across the region. So, what inspires her, and what advice does she have for other women keen to advance their own career in tech? Sandy shares more about her story. 
  I grew up in a small town in Sri Lanka. Our parents worked hard to ensure we had access and opportunities. I shared a computer with my brothers and sisters. I remember how hard we worked to earn computer hours, whether that’s chores or acing in a test. So, technology was always part of my life and always around me. But it’s really with the introduction of smartphones I became truly passionate about it. I loved how it simplified seemingly difficult tasks and made technology accessible for everyone. That’s something that always appealed to me. 
  Starting from university, being a woman in tech was not as easy as I had made up in my head. There is a lot of prejudice. Whether that’s lecturers or peers who thoughts girls can’t code or comprehend certain topics… But at the same time there were people around me who empowered me and supported my success. After my degree, I entered the IT industry as a junior project manager. There, again, I learnt that within this industry to prove myself and to establish myself, everywhere I went I had to work twice as hard. Because there is a deep-rooted prejudice that you are working against - there have been examples where I have been turned down opportunities and the feedback that I was given was that they thought I was too confident. In another instance, the agile coach who came to train the scrum team had given my manager feedback that you don’t hire a woman to do a man’s job. Because delivery was considered to be a leadership role that sits with men. I was angry at first but at the same time this instance changed me. It fuelled me to do better and be better. I was no longer trying to prove myself. Instead, I wanted to build teams who accept everyone and wanted to do their best every day and work towards meaningful outcomes. And that has been my mission since then. This is an ongoing challenge for women in tech and other industries.  So, it's important to create more opportunities and support framework for women. 
  Working at NCS with Hostplus has been my most exciting career project to date. I am so proud of the team and the ways of working we have built for this client.

             You can drop us a call or email Sowmiya Selvakumaraswamy | Engineer Innovation, S&A - AI Strategy  Sowmiya Selvakumaraswamy is an award-winning emerging tech specialist at NCS Australia. Early in 2025, Sowmiya was recognised as the  , which celebrate the women who drive innovation, create change, smash glass ceilings and forge bold new paths for everyone to follow.   While she’s still earlier in her career, Sowmiya has already notched up impressive achievements. She’s led the development of cutting-edge AI and AR/VR solutions, including a Metaverse Solution for NTUC, Singapore, which she presented to the nation’s Prime Minister; and combines an innate ability to push the boundaries of AI, VR and ethical innovation while finding time to champion diversity, inclusion and accessibility in technology too.   So, what drives her at work as she pushes the limits of innovation and tech? She shares more in this career profile. 
  To me, tech has always been the closest thing to magic. I was fascinated by it from childhood, so I don’t think I ever decided to pursue tech - I just never let go of my love for it, even as society tried to discourage me. And it’s not just me - I’ve never seen a child dislike science or technology. But as they grow, especially girls, they are often discouraged from following that passion. People told me the same, but I’m so glad I didn’t listen. 
  I had a tough time in school. The traditional education system just didn’t work for me. In fact, I even failed computer science in high school. But the joy that coding, science, and technology brought me was so immense that, despite discouragement from friends and family, I kept returning to tech. While I struggled academically, I thrived at solving real-world problems once I started working. No matter where life took me, I always felt drawn back to tech - nothing else gave me the same excitement. Cliché as it sounds, I’m glad I followed my heart, even when it logically didn’t make sense why someone who struggled in school would pursue a career in tech. 
  The AR project I built to manage transportation disruption was incredibly rewarding. It wasn’t just a gimmick or marketing tool; it actually solved a significant problem. The idea was that, during a transportation disruption, instead of relying on physical signage, which becomes difficult to manage during large-scale disruptions, we developed an app that displayed AR signs based on your location and redirected you to your destination.  The best part came when one of the people managing the disruption was so excited about the app that he immediately called his coworkers to show them. His curiosity was so strong, he even asked about the company behind the app and wanted to learn more. For me as a developer, that’s the dream - creating a product so good that it doesn’t need marketing or promotion. Seeing the joy on the user’s face truly made my day, and honestly, my year.  
  It’s that magical feeling when you code! Being able to create something from just a single line of code feels like casting a spell. Especially when I’m making VR apps, I can literally build a whole world from just a few lines of code. What could be more fun than that? For me, joy is the ultimate motivation in any work. When you're enjoying what you do, you never need external motivation. What drives me is the immense joy coding brings and the endless possibilities it unlocks. The excitement of bringing ideas to life and solving problems keeps me inspired every day. 
  To the women wanting to pursue a career in tech - first of all, thank you. You have no idea how much of an impact you’re about to make. The industry needs your perspective and talent more than ever. As Maya Angelou beautifully put it, "Each time a woman stands up for herself, without knowing it possibly, without claiming it, she stands up for all women." Your presence in tech isn't just for your own growth; it's for all women, as your contributions will help shape the future, especially in the evolving world of AI.

Maritime Singapore is one of the lifelines for the nation’s economy. As a global hub port and international maritime centre, Singapore needs to leverage technology and innovation to stay ahead. What makes a port smart? NCS’s Point of View on Next-generation port operations Innovation in action digitalPORT@SG™ Singapore Maritime Data Hub Ship height detection system The route forward explore more 
                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Maritime Singapore is one of the world’s busiest container hub ports, and the fifth largest ship registry in the world. It is home to over 5,000 maritime establishments and 130 international shipping groups. But after decades of operation, the maritime sector must evolve to address new challenges. Vessels are getting larger, and there are more of them than ever before. Ports aim to turn ships around in the same period of time, despite much higher volumes of cargo. What’s more, the increased size and number of ships will put great demands on Singapore’s limited sea space. In addition, Maritime Singapore must respond to disruptive technologies and business models, increasing manpower constraints, and rising expectations around safety standards and efficiency. On top of that, the seaport is under pressure to reduce its carbon footprint and become more sustainable. The consolidation of container terminals in the city to Tuas Port is an ideal opportunity to reinvent Singapore’s maritime industry for the digital age. The new port could adopt an innovative operating concept and cutting-edge technologies to enable next-generation port operations. This will help Singapore cement its position as a leading port, even as global competition intensifies. In this paper, we will examine what a smart port could look like, explore use cases, discover examples of innovation in action, and explain why NCS is well-positioned to deliver smart ports. Leading ports across the world are aspiring to transform their operations. Their goal is to become smart ports levering on digitalisation and automation. Our smart port vision focuses on enhancing port safety and efficiency, boosting productivity and delivering better customer experiences. We achieve this through digitisation, automation and the development of next-generation port systems. The idea is that when ships call at the port, they should not have to wait at the anchorage and take up limited sea space. Instead, the port can immediately dispatch a pilot to bring the ships to berth, for cargo operations to commence immediately. The port provides just-in-time services for bunkering, provision of water and supplies, minor repairs, and the changing of the crew. After a quick turnaround, the ship can continue on its way. Let’s delve deeper into the main use-cases to better understand how NCS can help port operators transform this vision into reality. To enhance port user experience, there should be a digital platform to streamline all transactions such as vessel, immigration and port clearances that each vessel needs to fulfil when it arrives at the port; and enable secure cross-border data sharing making the port 100% paperless, saving hundreds of thousands of person-hours each year. Blockchain technology has a great potential to transform the port industry in a big way. For example, having a Secured Maritime Application Realtime Transactions (SMART) platform to replace physical certificates for ship registrations and seafarers with tamper-proof eCertificates will generate significant savings for ship owners, port authorities, and seafarers world-wide.  SMART can also be applied in the bunkering sector to reduce paperwork, enhance transparency and security of sharing critical information among the stakeholders. To become a smart port also means the ability to derive maximum value from the big data that one has. A data-driven port can leverage advanced analytics for sense-making such as automated detection of vessel movements to pinpoint infringements, hotspots and near-misses.  Using powerful video analytics, ports can automatically detect oil spillages, smoke pollution and illegal activities. With the proliferation of drone applications, it is expected that marine drones will be deployed increasingly in the near future, for instance in ship-to-shore deliveries and remote ship inspections to minimise human contact during a pandemic. A fully integrated port operations require a common situation awareness picture to be shared among all operational units within the organisation.  This can be achieved by setting up a port digital twin to facilitate effective management of marine incidents, marine enforcement, and deployment of next generation vessel traffic management system with e-navigation capability. In the past few years, we have been awarded several major projects by the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA). These have enabled us to accumulate expertise in the maritime industry. We helped MPA to develop and deploy a one-stop portal – digitalPORT@SG™ – that enables shipping companies to submit all port clearance documentation to different government agencies in one submission. This makes it much easier for shipping companies to meet regulatory reporting requirements and save the shipping community around 100,000 man-hours a year. These huge efficiency gains sparked swift uptake of the new portal – with 100% of port clearance submitted via the new digitalPORT@SG™ within a year of its launch. This new system will also help the government agencies achieve better port operations and coordination while optimising each ship’s time within our port waters. Faster processing also enables the port to clear more vessels and increase traffic throughput – boosting the maritime sector’s performance and strengthening Singapore’s standing in the global maritime industry as an efficient global hub port. We built a new centralised data hub, Singapore Maritime Data Hub (SG-MDH), that enables shipping companies and government agencies to share maritime open data. This includes information on the vessel itself, its location, movement, arrival and departure times. SG-MDH was the world’s first open data-sharing platform established by a port authority. It has given developers a powerful platform for building new applications to support the maritime industry. For example, start-up Claritecs has used the platform to build an app for scheduling just-in-time bunker deliveries. Another start-up, SG Smart Tech, has developed a boat ride hailing app. We envisage that there is also potential to use SG-MDH to develop a maritime digital map for emergency responses, a sea space utilisation map, and more efficient ship-to-shore communications. In January 2020, SG-MDH won the Ministry of Transport’s Minister’s Innovation Award for its impact on the maritime industry. To date, more than 230 developers and 51 organisations have signed up for SG-MDH. The platform paves the way for more data-sharing between government agencies and the industry, including opportunity for extending it to other national governments. A key component of our smart port offering is our proprietary Ship Height Detection System (SHDS). It provides automated detection, tracking and height check of vessels entering and departing Cruise Bay Area. SHDS is a hybrid smart system utilising automatic identification system, low light cameras with advanced PTZ (Pan, Tilt, Zoom) platform and laser sensors to locate and detect vessel over-height. The built-in video analytics algorithm enables reliable automatic vessel height detection during vessel crossing whether it’s day or night, and under challenging weather conditions. This sophisticated system generates huge value-added benefits for smart ports. It boosts operational productivity, by accurately measuring ship heights and provides early warning and alarm to relevant parties. Most importantly, it improves safety of overhanging structures across key waterways. NCS is uniquely positioned to deliver smart ports. We have end-to-end capabilities to: By leveraging our expertise in the maritime industry and technical domains, we can work with clients to dive deep into specific smart port areas to conceptualise next-generation systems. We can also partner with customers to co-create new innovative solution concepts through POCs and ideation. Furthermore, we can generate new use-cases and industry applications for NCS solutions.

A revolution in tourism Australian tourism is booming, but customer expectations are higher than ever The history of AR What are the different types of AR? Business and government have an opportunity to come together Keeping ahead of the game How NCS Australia can help Meet our public sector expert Contact us 
                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  The basic concept of modern AR – the merging of the real world and computer-generated content – has actually been around in primitive forms since the 1960s. But it wasn’t until 2009, when the open source ARToolKit was launched, that the scale of its potential started to become clear. It is now an extremely fast-growing industry, which is predicted to be worth US$198 billion dollars by 2025.  And with up to 2.4 billion mobile AR users,  it’s not a market that can or should be taken for granted.   The possibilities are near limitless. Travel and arrival into the country can be informed and stress free. Tourism boards can develop interactive city tours or interactive navigation applications. Museums and cities can become more immersive, bringing the past (or present) to life by providing detailed information about objects and places.   Hotels have potential to adopt AR for everything from keyless room entry to creating virtual tourist information areas in their lobbies. And navigating a new city becomes safer and easier with rich integration of information and transit systems into existing apps such as Google or Apple Maps. Essentially, every important moment of a trip away can be made easier and more memorable.   We all know that Australia is a wonderful place to visit. Fantastic weather. Some of the finest beaches in the world. Exceptional, diverse food.  Arguably, we have it all. And tourism is big business, with hundreds of thousands of businesses – and millions of jobs across the country – depending on it. Technology is playing an increasingly important role in attracting visitors. Travellers increasingly expect a seamless experience in which technology helps make every step of a trip away smooth – from booking the trip, to making the airport less stressful, to recommending restaurants on arrival.   The use of Augmented Reality (AR) technology to provide an interactive experience combining the real world and computer-generated 3D content is already driving changes in the tourism experience – and it has the potential to do even more.   - Ivan Sutherland develops the ‘Sword of Damocles’ at the University of Salt Lake City – a pair of glasses allowing users to view images in 3D.  - Boeing Computer Service researchers Tom Caudell and David Mizell coin the term ‘Augmented Reality’ to describe a head-mounted display for aircraft.  - Julie Martin uses AR in her theatre production ‘Dancing in Cyberspace’, featuring acrobats dancing alongside virtual objects on the stage.  - NASA use AR to assist with navigation during test missions.  - ARToolKit arrives, giving developers intuitive tools to create AR-based applications.  - Pokémon Go is released and is hugely successful, with over 500 million downloads by the end of the year    – uses GPS to overlay digital content onto the real world. The hugely successful Pokémon Go AR game used GPS to locate, train and battle virtual Pokémon which appear on mobile devices as if in the real world.   – this works by scanning a certain marker to trigger augmented content. It opens up a world of opportunities to make museum exhibits, and even entire cities, more interactive.    – this sophisticated technique recognises objects, colours and patterns around the user. Due to its complexity, it requires powerful hardware to make it run reliably.   There is a clear opportunity for the Australian tourism industry, from both the public and private sector, employees, employers and travellers, to come together to take an integrated approach to building a world-leading immersive framework. And there is some evidence of this happening already. For example, in 2021, the Great Barrier Reef Foundation partnered with Snapchat to provide an interactive look at reef restoration, powered by AR.  Projects like this tap into the same sense of community and gamification that Pokémon Go capitalised on so successfully. And with such an important – and sometimes neglected – history, it’s easy to see how Australian landmarks could use AR to bring the past into vivid, engaging life. There are also many wider opportunities and use cases for AR including in areas such as safety and training.  An example of what’s possible is modelled in Singapore’s National Library Board’s (NLB) innovative collaboration with NCS. 
  In collaboration with the National Library Board (NLB) to support its LAB25 (Libraries and Archives Blueprint 2025) Singapore Storytellers role, NCS leveraged AWS services to create an interactive AR web app prototype, enabling citizens to discover the stories behind iconic landmarks anytime from their devices. This prototype lays the foundation for a more connected and curious Singapore, unlocking the secrets of our shared heritage in thrilling new ways.   Discover more about this regional case study and how  .   Domestic tourism spend reached over $100 billion in Australia in a recent year.  As well as attracting foreign visitors, persuading Australians to holiday at home is also potentially lucrative.  The government’s previous high profile Come and Say G’day campaign, featuring actors Rose Byrne and Will Arnett, has shown that tourism is at the forefront of its thoughts. With tourism spend so important to a flourishing economy, investing in technology to ensure Australian tourism stays ahead of the competition makes a lot of sense.  NCS’   uses intelligent video analysis to detect and analyse objects, people and events in video feeds. It has a wide range of applications and can be used in a number of industries, including tourism, where it can support capacity management, evaluate exhibit popularity and improve visitor data. The platform is designed to work seamlessly with existing video infrastructure, including cameras and video management systems.  Integrating AR and additional technologies further into the tourism experience fits with the Australian Government’s overall approach to the provision of digital services. Its digital strategy states that ‘by 2030, the Australian Government aims to use data and digital technology in innovative ways’.  Projects like the Singapore National Library Board show what can be achieved quickly, with the right collaborative approach and the right partners in place.   NCS Australia provides services and solutions in consulting, digital, applications and cloud. Our diverse workforce has delivered a wealth of large-scale, mission-critical, and multi-platform projects for governments and businesses nationally.

Healthcare facilities are looking to artificial intelligence to optimise operational performance at a time when rising demand for their services is stretching resources and limiting the patient experience. Singapore-based ICT service provider NCS has responded with a platform that brings AI to the heart of a more responsive operational model. Challenges for healthcare providers Leveraging AI to address these challenges Looking to the future explore more 
                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Improving operational efficiency has emerged as a priority for healthcare facilities as they seek predictive ways to manage and allocate resources at a time of ever-increasing demand for their services. Many of them are now turning to AI as a key enabler of a more progressive approach, helping them to plan their logistical responses based on the latest data – and maintain their focus on delivering end-to-end patient care of the highest quality. A growing patient load creates significant operational challenges, not least for the management of the patient experience itself. For example, where appointment schedules are not properly optimised, the disruption to patient flow throughout a facility can have a significant impact on waiting times. Providers need to be able to sustain a consistent flow of patients and visitors, and meet it with appropriate resources, including clinical staff, hospital beds and operating theatres, at every stage of the patient journey. If these challenges are not dealt with adequately, the operational consequences can mount up: dissatisfied patients, and inefficient and expensive resource utilisation. Inconsistent patient flows create long queues at more congested points. Other service locations stand idle while still consuming power and human resources as they wait for patients to come through. In response to this typical situation, data scientists from NCS’ AI team have built a schedule optimisation tool – the Enterprise Schedule Optimisation Platform – that demonstrates how AI can plan more effectively than humans as the demand for healthcare services grows. Healthcare administrators can only engage with a limited number of data points simultaneously. But AI can compute exponential permutations from a practically limitless source of data points, building predictive models that enable real-time operational response from the provider as well as helping them to plan future resource allocation. This concept is now being developed at the   (SNEC), which has partnered with NCS to design, build and deploy a new Appointment Scheduling Optimiser (ASO). Easy to configure by trained business users, the ASO will transform the clinic’s operations, reducing patient waiting times and allocating resources more efficiently. "Currently, appointment scheduling for all patient visits including those requiring initial consultations and the necessary same-day eye services and investigations is a time and labour-intensive process handled by appointment staff," says Jim Gu, SNEC’s chief operating officer. "To address the growing volume of appointment requests and limited visibility over demand at multiple service stations resulting in bottlenecks and long clinic waiting times, SNEC collaborated with NCS to leverage the ASO to resolve the various pain points." The new approach disrupts the traditional mindset of taking patients’ exact preferences for specific dates and appointment times, gathering instead more general preferences from patients who are due for appointments within a particular timeframe. Using NCS’ AI technology, advanced analytics and machine learning capabilities, the scheduler will consider these inputs as well as resource variables – clinician schedules and availability, types of service, facility availability – and objectively generate an optimal schedule. The ASO will also be responsive to real-time changes, re-optimising schedules to accommodate events such as patient no-shows or unavailable resources. This level of versatility combined with the ASO’s ability to maintain optimised scheduling in response to rapid shifts in service demand makes for a powerful AI-fuelled proposition.  vision for healthcare digitalisation is based on the idea that AI is a key driver, which can bring a comprehensive range of benefits to every aspect of healthcare services. These benefits are already being realised on a number of fronts, from robotic nursing assistants and fall-prevention solutions to intelligent speech and sentiment recognition for call centres, and video analytics solutions for managing security and social distancing enforcement. "AI is a key catalyst in ushering a new paradigm where healthcare providers can leverage it as a productivity multiplier to continue to deliver sustainable, quality healthcare services and further improve the patient experience in the face of rising costs and limited healthcare resources," says Daniel Ng, Enterprise Architect, Healthcare at NCS. “AI in healthcare is most effective when it sets out with the intention to support, and not supplant, the patient-doctor relationship. Many of the algorithms we employ today are well known in the AI world. Only when it enhances our healthcare workers’ ability to focus their hearts and minds on patients – by abstracting the transactional or computationally complex tasks responsibly – can they then find their place as healthcare solutions,” says Yong Xu Chang, Practice Lead for Applied Analytics at NCS.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  After experiencing two winters, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly driving developments in technology and businesses, from autonomous vehicles to medical diagnosis, moving AI from theory to commercial applications. These innovative applications are increasingly important and becoming more prevalent in society. Common areas where AI are found to be effective and efficient include analysis of huge amount of data and information in a consistent and speedy manner; or when mundane operational tasks can be automated.  In the healthcare industry,  AI has been utilized to reduce time spent on administrative and operational tasks such as claims processing and patient administration among others. This helps to free up healthcare workers’ time and can be channelled to improving patients’ care and experiences. AI can also help to break the iron triangle of healthcare (triple constraints on Quality, Access and Cost).  For example, in telemedicine, AI-triage consultations and medications help to provide access to rural areas patients (or urban cities with serious traffic congestions), at an affordable cost and with similar qualities as a physical doctor’s visit.  Across the healthcare spectrum, the implementation of the appropriate AI tech can add value to clinicians, administrative staff and of course, the patient.  Given its highly infectious nature and easy transmission of COVID-19 through human contact or exposed surfaces, the use of robots and AI can help greatly reduce the potential of coronavirus transmission by reducing human contact, protecting frontline healthcare workers, administrative staff and the public at large. NCS has deployed AI-powered thermal cameras with several public healthcare providers in Singapore. Given the manpower crunch at these healthcare facilities, the use of these cameras helped to reduce the need for manpower required to carry out manual, one-to-one temperature measurements with handheld scanners.  These cameras can be integrated to the visitor and employee management system and contact tracing systems to facilitate monitoring and further follow-ups as required by the healthcare providers.  At the Community Care Facility (CCF) located at the Singapore Expo to manage recovering COVID-19 patients with milder symptoms, NCS co-implemented Robotic Process Automation (RPA) solution to automate the admission, discharge and transfer of patients into/out CCF, which was previously done through a manual data entry method. “The RPA solution helped to improve operational efficiency at the CCF, which had an indirect impact on the patient experience,” explained Jim Lim, Healthcare Sector Lead, NCS. NCS’ Robot Health Manager helped in the remote surveillance of persons to detect unwell persons using audio and video analytics (for quick isolation or attention). The self-navigating robot identifies Persons of Interest (POI) contactless vital signs monitoring (temp, heart rate), sound and gesture sensors to detect cough. “As a key technology partner with over 30 years of solutioning experience in the healthcare sector, NCS is committed to building our NEXT digital capabilities to meet the current and future needs for public and private healthcare institutions in Singapore,” said Jim. In the clinical setting, AI can be applied to great effect in areas of medical imaging such as CT scans and X-rays, in providing radiologists better insights and helping them make informed decisions. Thanks to advancement in deep learning technology in AI, it can analyze complicated medical images to better aid clinicians in detection and diagnostics.  NCS Corp Labs’ in-house researchers leverage the latest tech, including AI and they co-innovate with local research institutions such as Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and public healthcare clusters with an aim to reduce administrative and operational tasks by healthcare workers. “We are also working on the SG Health Assistive and Robotics Programme (SHARP), together with the National Research Foundation (NRF) and Ministry of Health (MOH) to increase the use of assistive and robotic tech in healthcare, as well as to reduce the burden of repetitive tasks,” said Dr. Yan Shi Xing, Director, Corporate Labs and Product Development, NCS. He shared that while China is leading in the area of medical AI and has many organizations involved in the training of AI models, the AI governance framework in Singapore emphasizes on responsibility and reliability.  “Although AI and deep neural networks can help predict outcomes, there may be occurrences of black box AI where the outputs and operations are not explainable. In the context of healthcare, explainable AI is a very important topic,” he added. This is also why Singapore takes a very cautious approach in applying AI in healthcare, especially in the clinical context. Outside of the clinical setting, the use of AI can also add value to both patients and healthcare professionals in the entire healthcare journey. For instance, to improve the overall patient experience, AI can be used to automate repetitive processes, process huge data in minimal time, and without human error. Overseas companies like UK’s Babylon Health and China’s Ping An Good Doctor use AI chatbots for the initial triaging of patients symptoms and conditions, saving time and bring convenience to consumers/patients.  At Singapore’s Tan Tock Seng Hospital, patients get their medication in 10 minutes and that includes the time they take to walk from the doctor’s office to the pharmacy. This is made possible with the Outpatient Pharmacy Automation System (OPAS) which integrates automated dispensing machines and scanning devices into the medication workflow to manage tasks such as the picking, packing, labelling, assembling, verifying and dispensing of medication.  With the system automating 80 per cent of the medication dispensing workflow, it also helped to improve staff productivity by doing away with the rework and reducing the number of calls they make to clarify prescriptions. NCS is currently exploring with healthcare and eldercare providers in Singapore to make use of teleconsultation tools to allow one-to-one interactions between patients and doctors.  “We are also looking at deploying autonomous vehicles that are powered by AI algorithms for use in enclosed healthcare campuses for delivery of drugs and diagnostic tools. Additionally, we are seeking opportunities to work closely with life sciences and pharma industry to see how we can use our AI capabilities to help with reducing clinical/pharma trials,” said Jim.  Another concept that NCS is looking to explore is the creation of AI-assisted robotic nursing assistants, which support nurses in carrying out tasks such as measuring a patient’s vital signs, delivering and dispensing medication as well as delivering items to patients autonomously. These robotic assistants, also known as Florence, generates up to 20% freed-up time for nurses to focus on patient engagement, according to early stage trials by NCS.  Currently, NCS is also embarking on a pilot project with healthcare providers on the use of AI algorithms to assist patients to make decisions on the various healthcare financing schemes available during their hospital stay, which can help reduce complexity and create a seamless experience for patients.    To learn more about NCS' healthcare solutions, click  .

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  Delivering the right medication, in the right dose, to the right patient, at the right time – these are the essential 4 “rights” (4Rs) in administering medication. And NCS has been working with hospitals in Singapore to achieve this through a Closed Loop Medication Management System (CLMMS) which incorporates the Electronic Inpatient Medication Record System (eIMR) developed by NCS. CLMMS is a revolutionary process that leverages automation and intelligent systems to improve the entire medication administration process from the way doctors prescribe medication to how each dose of medicine is consumed by patients. This enables hospitals to significantly improve patient safety and the efficiency of healthcare staff even as patient volumes grow. eIMR is a key component of CLMMS, enabling doctors to order medication electronically and pharmacists to review the prescriptions and provide interventions, if required, before the medication is served by nurses to patients in the wards. We have also built interfaces between eIMR and the automated dispensing machines and hand-held scanning devices in the hospital to enable a closed-loop approach to ordering, dispensing and administering medication in the course of patient care. Implemented across National University Hospital, Tan Tock Seng Hospital and Institute of Mental Health, the system helps enhance patient safety through the 4Rs. It enables early detection of risky medication regimes which could cause overdosing, allergic reactions in patient or result in cross-drug interactions, and allows for timely intervention by pharmacists to prevent medication errors.

FIONA or Forensic Integrated Operations Network Applications is an IT initiative by the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) to streamline the administrative processes and workflow associated with forensic medical services. HSA’s goal was to reduce the manpower required for data entry, improve data flow within the Forensic Medicine Division and better coordinate with external agencies such as the police for case registration. It was also looking for a way to improve the tracking and management of bodies and related document flows. To address these requirements, NCS integrated a suite of technologies to create a wireless, paperless environment for the Forensic Medicine Division. An Integrated Track and Trace framework was implemented using RFID technology to track the movement of bodies and specimens. Clinical mobile notebooks were also introduced for body charting and note-taking in the autopsy suite while the pathologist was performing the autopsy. This allows the data to be synchronised with HSA’s servers, removing the need for manual data entry. Documents such as post-mortem reports can also be generated directly through FIONA. FIONA proved to be a breakthrough for HSA. The adoption of RFID technology greatly increased efficiency in the management of body parts within the forensic setting. The cost and effort associated with manual data entry was significantly reduced with the use of technologies for data capture and updates. Furthermore, with more streamlined workflows, inter-agency interaction such as the exchange of data between the police and HSA can now take place electronically, allowing cases to be processed much more rapidly.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  Pharmacies have never been so cutting edge – thanks to robotics, new technologies, and an intelligent software You would expect the gleaming new robotic armature, automated dispensing machines, and conveyor belts to be found on a factory floor. In this case, they are the tools used by pharmacists at the Tan Tock Seng Hospital. This spectacular showcase of mechanical efficiency has now taken over 80% of the picking, packing and assembly of medication at TTSH’s main pharmacy – a task that used to be completely manual. Previously, the pharmacists had to manually pick, pack and assemble medicines, a process that is tedious, time consuming and prone to error. In addition, patients had to wait an average of 20 minutes before they could collect their medication, according to TTSH. Today TTSH finds that patients get their medication in 10 minutes and that includes the time they take to walk from the doctor’s office to the pharmacy. This dramatic change is due to the tight integration of different technologies and robotics from around the world that make up the Outpatient Pharmacy Automation System (OPAS). The OPAS is the brainchild of several medical institutions in Singapore – Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH), National University Hospital (NUH), National Healthcare Group Pharmacy (NHGPh), and Integrated Health Information Systems (IHiS), with support from the Ministry of Health. NCS was the systems integrator tasked with building this management software or nerve centre of OPAS, which became known as Rxpress Software. This is the system that the pharmacy has been waiting for, and the NCS team was keenly aware that they had to get it just right. The collaborative effort between TTSH, the NHG Pharmacy and NUH has turned this vision into reality. A total of six pharmacists from each organisation formed the core team of stakeholders who worked closely with NCS to build the Rxpress Software. OPAS boasts technology that is unheard of in most pharmacies in Asia. It is a system that is built on the foundations of streamlining the workflow in medication picking, packing, labelling, assembling, verifying and dispensing through integration with automated dispensing machines and scanning devices. The improved medication workflow is not only reducing patient waiting time, but also raising efficiency and accuracy in the medication dispensing process. The aim is to automate processes that are repetitive, such as picking, packing, labelling and assembly of medicine. The other goal is to improve staff productivity by doing away with the rework and reducing the number of calls they make to clarify prescriptions. Previously, the TTSH staff had to rework 450-540 of the packed medication daily, due to patient’s drug preferences, costs or remaining medicines at home. Staff productivity was also affected by the high volume of phone calls of up to 130 in a day from the pharmacists to the physicians to clarify and verify issues. OPAS has given the pharmacy a complete makeover, with brand new technology and an ultra-efficient workflow. Now, prescriptions are filled faster and more accurately, staff productivity is higher, and patients enjoy a better care experience. The system has halved patient waiting times, with the average waiting time at TTSH and NUH being 10 minutes, and 15 minutes at NHG Pharmacy. In general, 20% of patients now wait 5 minutes or less for their medicines. Now, the TTSH pharmacy staff can be stationed at the specialist clinics, instead of the pharmacy, to review medication with patients and make changes before the drugs are packed, increasing their job satisfaction and lowering employee turnover costs. This has also helped to reduce rework, saving $5.8 million a year3. With OPAS, rework rates at TTSH have dropped from 30% in 2011 to 5%; at NUH, from 30% to about 8%; and at NHG Pharmacy (Chua Chu Kang Polyclinic) from 15% to 8%. With the productivity savings and improved patient care experience, OPAS promises to transform the pharmacy workflow. OPAS can be easily scaled up to expand the pharmacies’ capacities and is flexible enough to be deployed in smaller scale settings. Finally, to top it all, the achievements of the OPAS system has received recognition at the National Infocomm Awards 2014, where it was the First Runner-up for the Most Innovative Use of Infocomm Technology in the public sector. The biennial series of national level awards is Singapore’s highest recognition for infocomm innovation. Share this article on: Discover how you can chart your career and elevate your skills.

Demand for personalised service has grown at a time when the landscape of work has undergone a dramatic transformation in recent years, driven by technological advancements, shifting workforce expectations, and, most notably, the global COVID-19 pandemic.   An unforeseen byproduct of the pandemic was the enforced acceleration of digital transformations in both the private and public sector. Overnight, businesses were forced to adapt to survive. With entire workforces under lockdown, employees urgently needed the tools to work from home. And new ways were found to continue to meet citizen and customer expectations in a dramatically changed landscape.   An earlier survey by the Committee for Economic Development of Australia ( ) looked at the ‘Six Pillars of Customer Experience Excellence’, including personalisation, time and effort, resolution, integrity, expectations and empathy. CEDA found that the Australian public sector made ‘great advances in delivering improvements in customer experience and doing so during some of the most challenging times.’ Australians’ expectations didn’t waiver during the pandemic – on the contrary, they expected the government to continue delivering services and develop new ones to enable them to carry on as close to normal.  Today, more than a third of Australians continue working from home, with hybrid arrangements increasingly common, according to  . Demand for citizen-centric services is increasing, with major executive agencies at times continuing to hire new staff to reduce claims backlog and call wait times.   Confidence in the public sector in Australia is built on trust. To maintain this trust, key decision makers need to continue harnessing emerging technologies and improve approaches for delivering citizen service with intimacy. A recent survey of   found 85% of government workers surveyed had recently experienced a digital initiative being implemented in their department or agency.   There are warning signs, however, that show government agencies still have work to do. Despite innovative technologies helping streamline services, data issues are still prevalent – just 11% of public sector workers surveyed as part of the same study said they have no issues with accessing the data they need to do their jobs. As part of the same research:  63% of Australian government workers believed the adoption of new technologies made government services more accessible to citizens  33% of government workers often said they had to undertake tasks without all the data they need  74% of government workers mentioned never or very rarely using AI in their current role.  Working with a partner that understands the importance of service quality and the complex processes of government departments can help key decision makers at public agencies avoid inefficient data silos. NCS has used AWS cloud services complemented with ins8.ai, NCS’ hyperlocal speech recognition solution, to add generative AI features to the Singapore Ministry of Manpower's (MOM’s) Contact Centre.   You can find out more about this work in  .  This work has followed  .   The Australian Government has said that by 2030 it aims ‘to use data and digital technologies to deliver connected, accessible services which are centred around the needs of people and business.’ Helping public sector departments become more responsive to customer needs would enable them to keep the hard-earned trust it built from when the pandemic made innovation a necessity. And by leading the way on integrating new technology, there is a genuine opportunity to, in turn, inspire the private sector so that every Australian benefits.   NCS Australia provides services and solutions in consulting, digital, applications and cloud.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  NCS helped SkillsFuture support millions of Singaporean workers upskill, and a similar solution could support the skills gap here.   In this article we explore how NCS helped SkillsFuture Singapore build a new platform to help workers to develop and broaden their knowledge and skills – and how projects like this have given NCS Australia the experience and expertise to create similar training solutions to help Australian workers meet evolving needs.   The skills shortage in the Australia sector is well documented with   suggesting 36% of occupations had a skill shortage in a recent year. That’s an increase of 5% from the previous year’s figures. And these issues tend to be even more pronounced in remote and regional areas, because skilled workers are unwilling to move from major cities.   A lack of available skills also has a significant knock-on effect on the quality of services provided by the public sector. As competition for talent becomes more intense, many government agencies and teams can look to nurture and attract talent in-house, rather than outsourcing roles and responsibilities.  Based on recent data :   50% of occupations in the Technicians and Trade Workers category are in short supply nationally  48% of occupations within the Professionals group are in national shortage – including Health Professionals  47% of businesses reported they have increased their investment in staff training in a recent year.    It's certainly not that the Australian workforce is lacking in talent – it’s simply not being nurtured to meet new and emerging trends.   Take tech skills. Australia’s technology workforce is expected to exceed a million soon, yet only 7000 students are graduating each year with IT degrees,  with the shortage particularly affecting software knowledge – it’s not difficult to identify the long-term issues this disconnect is likely to cause businesses in an ever-evolving technological landscape.  AI, as usual, is a prime example. This is an area of almost unprecedented growth. It is already having a seismic effect on existing roles, while potentially creating entire new sectors. Yet Australia is falling behind its rivals. A recent report found that 33% of business leaders stated that their workplace is not using AI and has no plans to adopt it.  And a recent Salesforce report found that a lack of skills in artificial intelligence was hindering the take-up of generative AI to enhance frontline services across the public sector.  Although many businesses and public services have already embraced the potential of new technology to automate previously labour intensive tasks, some are missing opportunities to improve service delivery and meet sustainability targets.   The skills shortage isn’t just affecting how Australian businesses capitalise on new trends and address sustainability issues – it’s even posing a risk to the country’s security. Australia has a critical shortage of cyber security professionals, leaving it at heightened risk of suffering hugely damaging data breaches to businesses and government alike.   The federal government is acutely aware of pressing challenges to ensure future Australian competitiveness and security, as well as to ensure government bodies can harness the power of new technology to deliver services to citizens in more efficient ways. In 2024, the Jobs and Skills Australia (JSA) commissioner claimed work was   to raise skill levels in the public service – with generative AI and gender equality two of the main areas of focus.  And a strategy is in place. The government  intends to take a three-pronged approach to dealing with the shortage of tech workers: Boosting the number of IT graduates, bringing in more skilled workers from overseas and, crucially, reskilling existing workers. It’s on this latter point Australian public sector decision makers might consider looking to Singapore for some ideas and inspiration. SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) supports millions of Singaporeans in their pursuit of skills mastery. Recognising the critical role of swift data access and insightful analytics in providing Singaporeans with the opportunities to develop their fullest potential throughout life, SSG embarked on a transformative partnership with NCS.   Over a period of 12 months, NCS migrated the existing data environment and analytics platform from a constrained on-premises legacy system to a scalable cloud-based analytics solution. This allowed SSG to unlock significant cost savings and new potentials in data agility to support the evolving needs of Singaporeans in their upskilling and reskilling journeys.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  International trade drives economic growth and creates millions of jobs. Cross-border trade in goods is now worth over $1 trillion per year – which represents 40% of Australia’s GDP.  So even small improvements to make regulations easier for businesses to follow have the potential to give the Australian economy a significant boost.  How Australian businesses trade with global partners is constantly evolving. While trade volumes have grown significantly over the past decade, the rules, processes and technology simply haven’t followed suit. A recent survey found that 38% of Australian businesses that don’t trade globally felt they didn’t have enough information on how to trade in international markets.   Some stakeholders perceive Australian cross-border trade rules to be both complicated and prohibitively expensive. For example, a single shipment can pass through up to 30 organisations before reaching its destination.   Australia has long recognised the need to simplify its trade systems to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and maintain competitiveness in global markets. However, efforts to implement a fully simplified trade system have faced challenges due to several reasons. These include:  The complexity of existing systems which involves multiple stakeholders, including federal and state governments, regulatory agencies, customs, and private sector participants. Integrating these disparate systems into a unified, simplified framework is a complex and resource-intensive task.  Funding constraints which hamper large-scale reforms. Implementing a streamlined trade platform requires significant investment in technology, infrastructure, and training.  Legislative and regulatory challenges including complex interaction between domestic laws, international agreements, and regional trade obligations.  The differing priorities and needs of diverse stakeholder groups, including small businesses, multinationals trade unions.  Achieving consensus on the design and implementation of a simplified system can be challenging.  A lack of digital maturity and the predominance of legacy systems and infrastructure that make it difficult to transition to a fully digital and simplified trade environment.  An incremental approach over holistic reform including enhancements to the Integrated Cargo System (ICS) and customs processes, that fall short of creating a fully simplified, end-to-end trade system   Australia has recognised these shortcomings and is making strides toward improving its trade systems. The National Freight and Supply Chain Strategy aims to address inefficiencies and streamline processes. Efforts to digitise customs procedures and integrate data across agencies are ongoing. Collaboration with international partners to adopt global trade standards is also underway.  However, Australia will likely need to accelerate its reforms to stay ahead.  An example of the positive effect a holistic approach to trade and customs can have can be found In Singapore, where the government wanted to create a fully integrated system that could streamline and automate its customs processes, and continue innovating. 
  Singapore Customs plays a proactive role in strengthening Singapore’s position as a global trade hub. It maintains the trade regulatory compliance, facilitation, and security. Singapore Customs had the vision for a more efficient and streamlined customs regulatory operations, backed by real-time insights. Together with NCS, Singapore Customs embarked on a cloud-first transformation, re-platforming their legacy on-premises regulatory operations system onto the cloud. This not only alleviated the burden of maintaining physical data centres, but also allowed Singapore Customs to further improve regulatory operations and achieve cost savings. The innovations and improvements continue to solidify Singapore’s leading position in global trade.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  NCS has partnered with a state emergency services organisation to rebuild an alert app. Working behind the scenes, our team have helped reimagine – and deliver – a better app. This app which is hosted in the   cloud, uses a seamless multi-hazard alert system to keep Australians safe. The alert app, initially designed to provide bushfire alerts, was unable to handle the evolving needs of other hazards. Limitations of the app meant that some segments of the community were being left vulnerable to other emerging threats, beyond bushfires, signifying that the app was no longer fit-for-purpose. The rugged beauty of the terrain where this app is used comes with its own unique challenges. While bushfires have long been a primary concern, local communities are facing an expanding range of natural hazards from severe storms to floods and heatwaves. The emergency services organisation entrusted NCS with stepping up to support to rebuild this statewide app with accessibility and community safety in mind. The impact has been transformative. 
  The existing alert app had been designed primarily to provide bushfire alerts but was not equipped to handle an expanding range of natural hazards facing communities. The existing app could only inform residents about bushfires, meaning they remained vulnerable when it came to other natural hazards, such as severe storms, floods and heatwaves. The app had further limitations from an accessibility and inclusivity perspective, with concerns that people who were blind or had low vision may not be able to access critical information. A lack of cross-border notifications meant that people were missing vital alerts. It was also impossible to track emergencies affecting loved ones in different locations effectively and in a seamless, easy way. 
  NCS partnered with the organisation to rebuild the app, from the ground up, in just six months. A cross-functional team of technology professionals successfully delivered a comprehensive multi-hazard warning platform, on schedule and within budget. The rebuilt app also brings together timely and insightful data. This includes updates from multiple emergency services agencies that service country, metropolitan and state regions respectively as part of a seamless multi-hazard alert system. The new app’s development has been informed by insights from diverse community groups and members – including perspectives from people with visual disabilities. It is enriched by several new accessibility features. For example, the app detects if the user has accessibility voiceover enabled and, if so, will automatically open the list view instead of the map view. This screen is fully screen readable and users can choose to filter incidents and warnings in a variety of ways, including proximity to them, distance from any watch zones they have set up or by severity. All colours throughout the app have been chosen to provide high contrast that allow colour blind or low vision users to be able to read all the information provided. A native fire danger rating screen has been built so users can see quickly and easily the current rating in their area, including whether total fire bans are in place, and receive relevant automatic alerts in their watch zones. With the ability to monitor, track and receive alerts on bushfires, floods, hazardous materials, heatwaves, severe weather, floods, prescribed burns and fallen trees through the rebuilt app, the team have empowered local residents who sign up. They can be assured they’ll be well-informed and prepared – with more relevant and accessible updates in times of a greater variety of emergencies and dangers, 24-7 and all year round. Key features of the rebuilt alert app include:  The overwhelmingly positive response of Australians and visitors who have downloaded and used the app reflects its success and value for the community, as well as its overall user-friendliness and accessibility. The user experience it offers, as well as its accessibility, are both crucial since it is relied on during emergencies. The free app is among the top 100 News apps at the time of publishing, and has sent more than 140 million notifications for more than 17,000 bushfire incidents since launching a few years ago. App customer ratings have increased too – with the app getting favourable ratings in both the App Store and Google Play. This app has also been praised by not-for-profit organisations and the government, with its accessibility features commended, and parliamentary recognition highlighting the platform’s crucial role in community safety.

Shaping The Future of Transport | NCS AU shaping the future of transport  Contact Us Thank you for your interest. Autonomy, intelligence, connectivity and security are 4 key pillars that underpin the land transport sector's digital transformation. Challenges Pillar #1: Autonomy Pillar #2: Intelligence Pillar #3: Connectivity Pillar #4: Security The power of four explore more 
                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  “20-minute towns and a 45-minute city” – this is the long-term vision of Singapore’s Land Transport Master Plan 2040, where commuters and road users will be able to reach their destinations quickly and conveniently through well-connected walk, cycle or ride transport options. The transport system will be inclusive, providing support for the elderly, disabled, expectant mothers and family with strollers. And it will operate in a safer, healthier and more livable environment with clean energy fleets, more covered link-ways, new technology for safety. Digital technology and innovation will play a significant role in realising these goals and providing safe and seamless connectivity and services for commuters and road users. Today, seamless connectivity remains elusive with limited options for multi-modal real-time recommendations. Services are rigid with public transport buses following fixed schedules and plying mainly fixed routes. Other challenges encountered by the transport sector include manpower shortage and silo-ed systems which prevent information from being shared. As a result, insights are fragmented and transportation planning is based more on historical analysis and less on real-time interventions. But all these could soon change. Today, there are four key pillars of emerging technologies that have the potential to address the challenges of today. Working in tandem, they can help shape the future of land transport. The first pillar is autonomy. Autonomous vehicles such as buses and cars will play a key role in the future of land transport, addressing challenges such as a shortage of drivers, rigid time tables and inflexible routes. Autonomous capabilities are closely intertwined with connectivity and intelligence. For example, 5G allows for information to be streamed almost in real-time to provide precise public bus locations and estimated arrival times and real-time dynamic traffic management. These operational insights and decision support capabilities, when fed into an AI model, pave the way for the creation of innovative new services such as autonomous public bus services that respond dynamically to demand, or dynamic routing based on traffic conditions and crowding. Other automation possibilities in the area of land transport include the remote operation of drones and robots to enable applications such as maintenance inspection and last-mile delivery. The second technology pillar that will be key to the future of land transport is intelligence – advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and the movement of AI and analytics to the edge. Take the case of video, for example. Instead of a conventional video analytics architecture where video streams from cameras are streamed back to servers to be analysed, the trend is towards edge intelligence and a decentralised architecture where video streams are analysed inside the cameras themselves. This enables the infrastructure to keep up with the growing volume of surveillance network traffic and handle video more efficiently. It also reduces the latency between event and response. For example, if the video camera on an autonomous vehicle detects an object in front of it, localised intelligence which combines analytics and machine learning, together with automation capabilities, can lead to a swift response, for example, sounding an alert and applying the brakes. Another development in the intelligence space is the AI-powered IoT platform which allows for a consolidated view of IoT devices and environmental conditions to support decision making. The platform will also feature machine learning technology which will enable it to automatically identify patterns and detect anomalies, and take proactive action. One possible application of this is traffic management, where the IoT portal provides a consolidated view of connected vehicles and other smart objects on the road. Using machine learning technology, the system will be able to detect if there is, for example, congestion due to an accident. This will trigger a timely response, such as mobilising towing services and updating electronic signage in the vicinity to divert traffic to other routes. The inputs from sensors, combined with AI and machine learning capabilities, thus provide insights for informed decision-making and timely, automated responses. This can be applied to improve traffic and enforcement management, develop smart parking solutions, enhance crowd detection and enable predictive maintenance. The third pillar is connectivity. We envisage that there will be a 5G-led transformation of land transport systems leading to the emergence of connected vehicles, IOT-enabled smart infrastructure and smart roads, and the ability to crowd-source for real-time information updates and recommendations. 5G promises to deliver higher speed, density and availability at ultra-low latency. This enables near real-time streaming, processing and optimisation controls for a vast number of IOT devices, transport vehicles and infrastructure. One major use case for this would be autonomous driving. With the low latency of 5G networks, the safety of autonomous vehicles can be enhanced with road hazard and accident avoidance systems which are capable of detecting hazards and triggering an automated response almost in real-time. 5G also paves the way for improved facilities and service innovation such as connected buses and bus stops, in-vehicle infotainment and shopping, detection of illegal parking and real-time discovery of parking availability. The fourth key technology pillar for the future of land transport is security. With increased connectivity and autonomy, the domains of IT and operational technology (OT) have started to overlap. This has implications for the safety and security of land transport systems. For example, cyber attacks can exploit security loopholes in an operational rail transit system to disrupt services. Or attackers can use these loopholes as a channel to infiltrate enterprise networks. The use of AI-led automation technologies will enable the land transport sector to proactively manage these cyber threats. For example, Advanced Security Operations Centres empowered by advanced threat intelligence, cybersecurity analytics and machine learning capabilities will be able to detect and defend against threats to both IT and OT systems. They can carry out effective triaging and threat detection, user behavioural analysis, threat anticipation, incident analysis /investigation and automated proactive incident response such as SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation and Response). The four pillars of technology will continue to evolve and transform Singapore’s land transport landscape. Over the next 5-10 years, we envisage the emergence of driver-less pods to ferry commuters within the Central Business District, Orchard Road, One-North and the universities. At the new Tengah car-free town, a new underground people mover will enable commuters to get around quickly and safely. More drones and robots will be used for last mile-delivery and to enhance surveillance, inspection and maintenance works. With advanced connectivity, intelligence, automation and security, land transport will become more efficient, seamless and safer.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  Climate change, emerging technology and shifts in demographics have set the stage for a major period of disruption of the Australian transport & logistics industry.   This report dives into the 5 biggest trends and makes technology related recommendations for senior executives.     In Australia, many vehicles currently already have some degree of automation and connection such as lane keeping, adaptive cruise control and park-assist. How organisations manage their transport fleets of semi or fully autonomous vehicles will become a challenge as they scale up from small pilots to larger programs. The demand for MaaS in Australia is here, with up to 46% of the Australian population willing to adopt. (1). - particularly the use of micro-mobility. Although banned from public roads in NSW and ACT, Australia still saw a rise in rental micro-mobility, and this is expected to grow further. More than 70% of Australian transport and logistics companies invested in new digital technology during COVID-19 (2). Amongst the emerging technology being embraced within this sector, big data and analytics stands out the most. Intelligent transport systems have already made progress in Australia from dynamic speed zones and active lane management to traveller information systems and e-tolling. We expect the scale and speed of change to continue with the global ITS market expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 7% by 2028 (3). Australia aims to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. As part of the plan, the Australian Government has created the Future Fuels and Vehicles Strategy – a technology led approach to reducing emission in the transport sector, and consequently creating new trends and changes for the industry (4).

                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  Our planet is already 1.1°C warmer than it was in the late 1800s and continues to rise. With growing concern globally from citizens around climate change, sustainability should no longer be an outlying factor, but at the forefront of your operational strategy. According to digital transformation strategist, Babu Krishnamoorthy, “alignment with the sentiment of community concern around climate change is essential to winning the hearts and minds of customers”.  For the transport and logistics sector, transitioning to electric vehicles (EV’s) is a key step in addressing global climate change. Uptake of EVs in Australia is increasing  across all segments including cars, buses and trucks,  While there is a lack of consistency between states in terms of rules and incentives to encourage EV uptake there is a growing appetite by governments and regulators across the board to accelerate the shift away from internal combustion engines (ICEs).  Mayor of Noosa Council, Tony Wellington reinforced the opportunities and benefits of embracing EV stating “The shift to electric Vehicles is an absolute no brainer, the technology is already here, rapidly improving and increasingly affordable. Electric Vehicles provide tangible, direct benefits for the individual, the community and the planet. Governments at all levels need to start showing leadership and stop dragging their heels. Noosa’s current electric bus trial is just the beginning of the transport revolution in our local government area” From vehicle availability and price uncertainty to charging complexities and perceptions of operational risk, transitioning to EVs can seem daunting. Here are some of the most common challenges we hear from clients.    EVs aren’t cheap, especially in comparison with their ICE equivalents. There is a lack of availability in Australia, which adds to this concern and according to NCS Australia’s Transport & Logistics Leader, Tim Staley    Almost all major manufacturers have now committed to the rollout of EV models with many announcing cut off dates for the production of ICEs, which is expected to lower prices for consumers.   Many countries have set dates to phase out ICE vehicle sales completely and implement incentives to encourage uptake. For example, in June 2022, the ATO announced a proposal to remove fringe benefits tax on eligible electric cars, further incentivising the uptake of EV’s in Australia .  There are also cost benefits related to running costs. When it comes to how we generate electricity, shifting your fleets to renewable energy such as solar or wind power is far cheaper than fossil fuels . When looking at maintenance and servicing costs, it has also been discovered that pricing reduces significantly over time when using an EV over an ICE vehicle . While we’re several years away from price parity, the long-term view on cost has a positive story. According to Babu, “there is a cost of ownership that balances itself over the lifetime of the vehicle.” Where businesses and consumer are moving between capital cities or over long distances, there is a significant feeling of ‘range anxiety’. The lack of charging infrastructure is a challenge that needs to be addressed in order for fleet and private vehicle owners to feel comfortable. While charging infrastructure hasn’t been built out sufficiently yet, steps are being made. For example, as part of the Australian Government’s Future Fuels and Vehicles strategy, there was an additional investment of $16.5million in grants announced in 2021 to support EV-fast charging stations across capital cities and regional centres . As a result, Australia can expect to see more electric vehicle charging and hydrogen refuelling infrastructure where it is needed and other incentives for organisations to adopt the change. Batteries are one of the common pain points for those wanting to transition to an EV. Given the new technology, there are several uncertainties around battery replacement and how long they will last. An EV battery in a standard electric vehicle generally reaches its end-of-life at 70% capacity (they approximately last between 10 – 20 years and to replace one can cost $10,000 or more depending on the model). Fortunately, today’s EVs have been engineered to go the distance and are covered by law, under warranty for at least eight years or 160,000 Km’s . While there still needs to be further research into the long-term use of EV batteries, manufacturers such as Tesla are finding new ways to innovate . By recycling batteries and extending the life of battery packs, it’s possible to close the manufacturing loop and create a circular economy. There is a significant opportunity for the transport and logistics sector to lead the charge and move away from using fossil fuels and outdated technology - in fact, they can actually influence this space and position themselves for future growth. While there is still ongoing debate around whether EVs or hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are the right solution, there are some steps you can take as an organisation to start your journey toward a greener future. It is important to address myths around operations, while providing opportunities to overcome objections, understand risk/reward and create value. Tim Staley states, “while organisations are looking to invest in electric vehicles in order to spend less on fuel (for example), there is latent hesitancy to adopt and embrace EV’s and build efficiencies into KPI’s…In order to realise the benefit, organisations are going to need to start running some EV thinking workshops to unpack long held operational assumptions, resolve issues and embrace the inevitability”.   For such a fast pace and changing environment, it’s important to incorporate strategies for rapid product development and roll out of new systems and platforms.  Businesses need a more agile approach, moving away from the traditional waterfall method.  With journey planning becoming more prominent within the logistics industry, businesses need to be able to capture the right data. From parking and charging locations to route tracking, it’s important to leverage emerging technology to produce accurate reporting on how your operations should function during the transition. More broadly, the shift to a new energy platform provides an opportunity for organisations to rethink how data can be used to drive innovation. The EV ecosystem is vast, and one that needs public and private sectors to come together to drive change. To build a successful green transport ecosystem, organisations need to work together – governments, energy providers, network operators and manufacturers should be collaborating to navigate the change.  “By being an early adopter and a big player, you have the ability to influence the space. If you’re an SMB, you can take advantage of the efficiencies of the larger organisations and use it as a mechanism to promote your zero emissions fleet.” - Babu Krishnamoorthy.  While there may be some challenges, Babu says “the future of EV's is bright. It's the future of mobility, logistics and transport from a fuel perspective”.    To learn more about the key trends driving the Australian transport and logistic market,  .

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  The inspection and maintenance of tyres are non-negotiable. Nonetheless, it is a tedious and labour-intensive task, especially for large fleets. NCS joined forces with a multinational tyre manufacturer to provide three cloud-based IoT platforms that offer real-time monitoring and management, reducing labour intensity, unnecessary breakdowns, fuel consumption, and emissions. Monitoring, inspecting and maintaining tyres takes time away from letting tyres do what they do best - be on the road. However, not ensuring that they are in the best condition can lead to devastating outcomes. Existing Tyre Pressure Monitoring Systems (TPMS) have also been deemed unreliable and too expensive. NCS leveraged Microsoft Azure to create Tirematics, Toolbox, and BASys for Bridgestone.   is a new TPMS that allows real-time tyre-monitoring through embedded sensors and powerful cloud-based stream analytics.   empowers field personnel worldwide with a fleet customer management system capable of conducting inspections and performance monitoring.   centralises and streamlines the retreading process to increase convenience and sustainable practices. NCS’ end-to-end management of these systems has achieved high cost-savings and helped validate Bridgestone as   sustainable mobility solutions provider. Tirematics significantly reduced costly tyre-related roadside breakdowns and lowered fuel consumption. Toolbox's compatibility with mobile devices allows the provision of higher-quality customer services. BASys’ efficient retreading tracker allows Bridgestone to reduce greenhouse gases emitted in the production and consumption of raw materials year-on-year.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  The Singapore maritime industry contributes about 7% of the nation’s GDP. Playing a crucial role in the global supply chain, Singapore is reputed to be one of the world’s leading hub ports1 and busiest container transhipment hubs. Its strategic location, along one of the world’s busiest shipping waterways2, paves the way for international business investments in Asia.  However, our Maritime industry has not prospered without its challenges. Limited sea space, ever-increasing vessel traffic and size, higher safety and efficiency expectations – these are just a few of the growing pool of difficulties faced. How can our ports embrace digitalisation and evolve into Smart Ports; automated, efficient and fully-integrated? In the webcast on  , NCS Industry Lead for Transport, Goh Kwong Heng, speaks to 2 maritime industry experts on the challenges and opportunities ports encounter on the journey towards increased digitalisation. Tan Wee Meng (Chief Technical Officer and Chief Sustainability Officer, Jurong Port) and Oh Bee Lock (Chief Executive Officer, Singapore Logistics Association) elaborate on how to advance port operations and technology, data driven smart ports and post-COVID-19 smart port operations, including digitalisation and technological trends and the demand for new skill sets.  With the formation of mega alliances and the increase in the size of ships and volume arriving into Singapore’s ports, major pain points for the transport logistics sector are the physical space and infrastructure available. In the same vein, there has also been an increase in demand for greater operations productivity due to compressed vessel turnaround times. To illustrate this, Bee Lock explains how as of January 2021, less than 40% of ships arrive on schedule. This means that more ships are arriving together, in addition to holding twice as much cargo. To top it all off, the COVID-19 pandemic has induced further congestion in key logistics nodes, limited cargo movement, and manpower constraints. It has been equally strenuous for port operators such as Jurong Port even though they started their digitalisation journey a significant time back. Wee Meng shares how Jurong Port handles both general cargo and bulk cargo, and how the challenges in both areas differ. This stems from the fact that the nature of the cargo is different; bulk cargo unloading can be mechanised to a much greater degree than general cargo unloading. As such, Jurong Port faces difficulties due to their high dependence on manual labour which compromised their productivity, different handling gears, stowage arrangement, and how stowage information is transmitted. In light of such challenges, NCS holds a Smart Port vision for enhancing connectivity, efficiency, productivity, safety, and user experience through a digital conversion of the maritime sector and the development of next-generation port systems. NCS’ perspective is that port transformation, through digitalisation, and the associated opportunities made available as a result, are not just necessary but viable. Kwong Heng describes how Smart Port Transformation can be split into two subsets - Smart Maritime Operations and Smart Container Terminals. The end goal for both is to boost the overall efficiency and productivity of port operations. Smart Maritime Operations targets improving user experience and safety of the port. Smart Container Terminals, on the other hand, aims at increasing labour productivity, port connectivity, and customer base. To achieve both outcomes, NCS has identified key thrusts for each, which comprise of the employment of various new capabilities such as:  Technologies to support the aforementioned capabilities are also proposed, such as: This webcast also explores some key enablers that are essential for Smart Port Transformation. As we transition into the new norm of today’s digitalised world, it has become apparent that we need to be innovative, collaborative, and most importantly, digitally savvy. Bee Lock shares that key enablers which catalyse this transformation are organisational agility, technological capability & resources, digital vision & strategy, and culture. All four of these enablers capitalise on the need to have a digital quotient (DQ), in addition to the conventional IQ and EQ, as it opens the doors for data fluency. The three industry experts also discuss the need for a Data Driven Smart Port, and how organisations can leverage their data to make smarter decisions for better business outcomes. We get insights into how port operators, such as Jurong Port, utilise data analytics to make the port more intelligent. For instance, Wee Meng explains how Jurong Port is in the process of developing a digital twin based on big data collected from the port. This digital twin will ultimately help to make scheduling of cargo flowing in and out of the port more efficient, thereby resolving any potential major congestion. Data Driven Smart Ports hint at a promising future where operations will be optimised to be more cost and time-efficient. Naturally, the discussion also considers the ravaging effects and challenges caused by COVID-19, and how port operators and the logistics industry are overcoming those challenges. Using the NCS 3 lenses to view digitalisation in a post-COVID-19 world – Retaining Freedom, Restoring Security and Rebalancing Touch, we recognise how the port industry is steadily steering through the pandemic and emerging victorious with the aid of digital transformation.  To glean the full depth of invaluable insights from these industry experts, watch the Smart Port Transformation Webcast  1:  2:  Share this article on: Discover how you can chart your career and elevate your skills.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  From purchasing a car to scrapping it, the Vehicle Registration & Licensing System (VRLS) has got the lifecycle of vehicle management covered. Introduced by the Land Transport Authority (LTA) of Singapore in 2006, VRLS connects motor agents, government agencies and industry players such as insurance, hire purchase and financial institutions to provide a one-stop information and services hub for the motoring ecosystem. For land transport, the future goes beyond building roads or creating a well-connected transport network. It is about total transport management to ensure sustainability and the creation of positive travel experiences for public and private transport users. In line with this, NCS has been developing and maintaining systems that make it easier and more convenient for members of the public to interact or transact with government agencies on transport-related matters. Examples include the online Certificate of Entitlement Open Bidding System and the Vehicle Registration & Licensing System. The VRLS enables motorists and businesses to perform vehicle-related business transactions from the convenience of their homes and offices, using a secure e-commerce platform that incorporates electronic authentication and automated financial and compliance regulatory checks. With VRLS, a road tax renewal can be completed with a few clicks of the mouse instead of having to travel to LTA to queue up for counter service. Car owners will also have all their vehicle-related transactions displayed in a single view which they can access easily and conveniently over the Internet. The self-help capabilities of VRLS have benefited LTA as well, allowing it to re-deploy its counter staff to higher-value customer service roles. Built for scalability, VRLS allows new online technologies to be plugged easily into the system, facilitating enhancements and upgrades. Over the past few years, major enhancements to VRLS included the integration of the Vehicle Inspection and Type Approval System, the implementation of a traffic offences portal, the introduction of electronic day licences and proactive notification of payments due.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  MyTransport.SG Mobile is an all-in-one travel toolkit for motorists and commuters. The mobile app with location-sensing capabilities was introduced by the Land Transport Authority in 2010 to cater to the growing population of technology-savvy private and public transport users who demand user-friendly and timely information while on-the-go. Traditionally, transport information was limited to navigational systems that provided route details to help motorists and commuters get from point A to B. What was lacking was the availability of real-time transport information to complement the route details and help the public refine their travel plans. MyTransport.SG Mobile addresses this by utilising a two-way engagement approach to deliver an interactive and content-rich experience. The app simplifies the process of checking on traffic news, road conditions, the location of electronic road pricing (ERP) gantries, ERP rates, parking availability, public and premium bus services, MRT and LRT stations, taxi call numbers and even the latest bidding results for the Certificates of Entitlement. One of the new features of MyTransport.SG Mobile is the public transport Journey Planner, a handy, intuitive guide which helps commuters map out the shortest and most convenient route to their destination using buses or trains. Key functions include the counting down of bus stops and train stations to the destination; a pro-active alert when nearing the destination; and one-touch access to the user’s favourite bus stops and train stations. A 360-degree interactive street view display and common taxi booking numbers are also included. The new features ensure that even commuters who are unfamiliar with the public transport system can travel at ease, without worrying about missing their stops or travelling in the wrong direction. MyTransport.SG Mobile complements LTA’s two other transport portals - ONE.MOTORING and MyTransport.SG. Share this article on: Discover how you can chart your career and elevate your skills.

Introduction Benefits and Risks of Generative AI Arising Challenges Does OpenAI have the legal right to use the personal information of individuals to train ChatGPT? Responsible AI through Governance Where to start? Summary Access our AI thought leadership report Access our AI+DR  self-assessment tool 
                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  Generative AI (GenAI) has emerged as a groundbreaking technology with immense potential to revolutionize various aspects of our society. From enabling digital transformation in both large corporations and small organizations, to enhancing creativity and productivity, GenAI, such as ChatGPT, has opened new avenues for innovation and progress. However, while we celebrate the possibilities offered by this technology, it is crucial to acknowledge that its unrestricted use can give rise to significant risks and unintended consequences.  In the context of unrestricted use GenAI, we delve into the multifaceted nature of GenAI, particularly ChatGPT, and the need for an appropriate governance framework to ensure responsible and beneficial deployment. We explore the inherent risks associated with the unbridled use of ChatGPT and shed light on potential challenges that may arise if adequate precautions are not taken.  Recognizing the importance of a balance between harnessing the power of GenAI and safeguarding against its potential pitfalls, we aim to equip individuals, organizations, and policymakers with a comprehensive understanding of the risks involved. Moreover, we provide a set of general guidelines that can serve as a starting point for mitigating these risks to ensure the responsible and ethical use of ChatGPT.  Through the establishment of effective governance measures, we can foster an environment where ChatGPT and similar technologies can thrive, to the benefit of society.   The rapid growth and use of GenAI in many applications is due to its potential benefits in multiple dimensions: However, the use of GenAI can be a double-edged sword as the technology also poses several potential risks [IMDA23a, Gartner23]: In addition to these challenges, it is also important to be aware of the potential for GenAI to be used for malicious purposes. For example, it could be used to create fake news articles, social media posts, or even videos. This content could be used to spread misinformation and disinformation, which could have a negative impact on society.   How do we strike a balance between enhanced productivity and the unethical use of ChatGPT? There are a few reasons why such a balancing act is challenging: As a result of these challenges, it is non-trivial to strike a balance between reaping productivity gains and the unrestricted or unethical use of ChatGPT. More work needs to be done to mitigate the risks and ensure that the tool is used in a responsible manner.   According to Gartner, data privacy is the biggest concern based on a survey of 713 IT Executives. This is summarised in Figure 1 below.   
   In general, OpenAI is likely to have the legal right to use personal information to train ChatGPT if the data is collected and used in compliance with applicable laws and if users have consented to this use. If OpenAI collects personal information from users who have agreed to its terms of service, which state that the data may be used to train ChatGPT, then OpenAI is likely to have the legal right to use that data for this purpose. However, there are some potential legal limitations on OpenAI's use of personal information to train ChatGPT. Some jurisdictions have laws that restrict the collection and use of certain types of personal information, such as sensitive personal data or data pertaining to children. Additionally, some jurisdictions have laws that give individuals the right to opt out of having their personal data used for certain purposes, such as for training AI models. For example, ChatGPT was banned by the Italian data protection authority at the start of April 2023 over privacy concerns. The Italian data protection authority, also known as Garante, temporarily restricted the chatbot and launched a probe over the artificial intelligence application's suspected breach. As Garante had accused OpenAI of failing to check the age of ChatGPT's users (who are supposed to be aged thirteen or above), OpenAI said it would offer a tool to verify users' ages in Italy upon sign-up. OpenAI explained that it would also provide a new form for European Union users to exercise their right to object to its use of their personal data to train its models. Access to the ChatGPT chatbot has since been restored in Italy [McCallum23].   The Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) published guidelines in July 2023, allowing limited use of Generative artificial intelligence (AI) in elementary, junior high, and high schools. The guidelines are intended to help teachers and students understand the characteristics of the technology, while imposing some limits due to fear of copyright infringement, personal information leaks, and plagiarism [Kyodo23]. The guidelines state that Generative AI can be used for educational purposes, such as: However, the guidelines also caution that Generative AI should not be used for the following purposes: The guidelines also state that elementary school students younger than age 13 can use AI, to a certain extent, under the guidance of teachers. The MEXT's decision to allow limited use of Generative AI in schools was a significant step, as Japan became one of the first countries in the world with such a government policy. The guidelines are still in the initial stages, and it remains to be seen how they will be implemented in practice. However, the move is a sign that Japan is recognizing the potential of Generative AI to transform education. On the other hand, the Australian Federal Government opened an inquiry last year into the use of Generative AI within its education system [Parliament23]. The Australian Federal Government's inquiry into the use of Generative AI in education is a significant development, as it was one of the first governments in the world to take such a step. The inquiry will examine  the following key areas: Schools in Australia have now officially rolled out the use of artificial intelligence bot ChatGPT. The decision to allow ChatGPT in schools was made after a consultation with teachers, students, parents, and education experts. The consultation found that there is a strong demand for the use of ChatGPT in schools, and that the potential benefits of using this technology outweigh the risks [Cassidy23, Beaumont24]. The Australian government Is working with OpenAI to develop guidelines for the responsible and ethical use of ChatGPT in schools. The guidelines will cover areas such as:   To address the ethical and societal concerns surrounding AI, including Generative AI, it is essential to develop and operationalise an effective governance framework within an organisation. These frameworks should be designed to ensure that AI is used in a responsible and ethical manner. Some of the overarching principles of effective AI governance include: Once the overarching AI principles have been defined, a governance framework that sets out how these principles will be put into practice needs to be developed. This framework should include policies and procedures for the development, deployment, monitoring, and evaluation of AI systems. Here are some example key elements of an AI governance framework: The US Department of Commerce National Institute of Standards and Technology AI Risk Management Framework [NIST24] and Singapore’s Infocomm Media Development Authority’s Model AI Governance Framework [IMDA24] provide useful guidelines and further details on how an effective governance framework might look. AI risk and impact assessments should be conducted regularly to identify and mitigate any potential risks. These assessments should consider the following factors: By conducting regular AI risk and impact assessments, organizations can ensure that AI systems are used in a safe and responsible manner.   GenAI can be used to create a wide variety of content, including text, code, images, and videos. This content can be used for good or malicious purposes, so it is important to have safeguards in place to prevent GenAI from being used maliciously. Some recommended practices that organizations should consider when adopting a responsible approach to AI, in particular with the rise of GenAI and ChatGPT, are as follows: In addition to these recommendations, it is also important to be transparent about how ChatGPT is used. Organizations should inform users about what data is being collected, how it is being used, and what they can expect from the output of the model. It is also important to have a process in place for users to report any problems or concerns they have about the use of ChatGPT. By taking these steps, we will go a long way in ensuring that ChatGPT is used in a responsible and ethical way.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  The reality is that many organisations still operate as if stability is the goal, shaped by rigid structures, incremental improvements, and risk-averse mindsets that create a sense of safety. The problem? Disruption isn't an issue to contain until the storm passes – it's the new normal. With the pace of technology, market, and regulatory shifts accelerating, the organisations that thrive don’t just react to change. They embrace it as an opportunity. They understand that business as usual means business as disrupted. That's why they build adaptability into their culture, leadership, and operations. The real question isn't whether change will happen. It's whether your organisation is built to move with it. 
  Many organisations treat change like an endless game of catch-up. They frame digital transformation as a series of projects, each designed to keep them relevant or to 'fix' the latest challenge. But this approach is flawed. – disruption is ongoing, not a one-time event. Just think about the current rate of disruption – climate, political, competitive – that continues to increase at a rapid pace. Siloed data, legacy infrastructure, cybersecurity risks, and talent shortages are all symptoms of a deeper issue: businesses designed for stability, not agility. If your strategy and culture are built around maintaining the status quo, the adoption of new tools will be unlikely to help you lead. 
  Organisations have been on the digital 'transformation treadmill' for years, with no end in sight. How do we build something more sustainable? The answer lies in the realisation that adaptability isn’t about reacting to a point issue. Continuous adaptability means building systems, processes, and mindsets that allow you to pivot as new opportunities and challenges emerge. If adaptability is adjusting to new conditions, then  adaptability can be defined as the capability to evolve – intentionally and repeatedly – by embedding agility into culture, leadership, and operations. It means: Technology is no longer a fixed asset - it's an enabler. Instead of being the end goal, it serves as a dynamic, temporary advantage that is constantly challenged and disrupted. Technology is now simply part of our lives and has no value if not backed by processes. A truly adaptable business builds change into its core and leads with innovation. This requires embedding adaptability into culture, leadership and operations. 
  Encouraging teams to test, iterate, and embrace failure as a learning tool means building a culture where employees are not afraid to experiment, but are empowered to do so. Organisations prioritising a test-and-learn mentality can quickly identify opportunities and refine their approaches in real time. 
  True adaptability requires leaders who embrace change and recognise that getting too comfortable leads to stagnation. These leaders inspire teams to view uncertainty and ambiguity as part of their day-to-day. Effective leadership strategies include fostering collaboration across departments and ensuring teams are aligned with a shared vision of resilience and growth. 
  Continuous adaptability starts with a strategy that aligns agility and resilience with an organisation’s objectives. Traditional, static strategies no longer work in a world where disruption is constant. Instead, organisations need evolving, 'living' strategies based on real-time data, market shifts, internal learning – and a shift from one-off technology implementations to a continuous innovation model. By embracing ambiguity, organisations can foster a culture where exploration, agility, and resilience become second nature. 
  A   comes from the Singapore Ministry of Manpower (MOM), which sought to improve its contact centre operations. MOM partnered with NCS to implement a generative AI-enabled system, significantly enhancing efficiency and service quality: The transition was not just about efficiency – it enabled MOM to continuously refine its approach to customer service. By automating routine tasks and freeing up agents, MOM created a more agile workforce that could quickly adapt to changing customer needs. The result? A deeper understanding of customer concerns, improved resolution rates, and a more positive work environment, contributing to heightened job satisfaction among contact centre agents. This case study highlights that adaptability is not about adopting new technology, but about embedding continuous evolution into processes to stay ahead of change. 
  The pace of disruption will only continue to accelerate. Organisations that treat adaptability as an afterthought will find themselves constantly reacting – struggling to keep up with an environment that refuses to stand still. True resilience isn’t about enduring disruption. It’s about using it as a catalyst for continuous innovation. The ability to pivot, rethink, and evolve must be embedded into an organisation’s DNA. This is what makes adaptability a strategy for staying relevant and competitive. Are you looking for a partner in your journey towards continuous adaptability? NCS collaborates with clients to develop strategies that ensure long-term resilience and agility in an ever-changing landscape.  .

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  Modern challenges require smarter, integrated solutions – ones that can provide real-time visibility into asset health, enable predictive and prescriptive insights, and optimise maintenance and investment decisions. This shift demands reimagining systems and approaches, with cloud-based platforms, AI, and digital twins at the centre.  In Part 4 of our asset management whitepaper, we share more our work with digital twins, and reflect on the importance of securing operational technology (OT) assets in today’s environment. 
  Digital twins provide a real-time virtual representation of physical assets, enabling a shift from reactive maintenance to predictive operations. 
  Enabling our clients to succeed is integral to our work at NCS. Here are some examples that showcase how we’ve delivered value.  exemplifies this shift through its deployment of a hybrid digital twin built on AWS IoT TwinMaker, SiteWise, and Grafana. The platform brings SCADA and IoT data into a predictive system accessible by frontline staff, enabling early detection of sewer pump anomalies and supporting faster interventions. The digital twin solution collected data from the existing SCADA data lake and brings the data feed online in a safe and effective approach. 
  A major regional utility engaged with NCS Australia through an innovation association within the water industry to modernise their IT/OT infrastructure through digital twin and cloud technologies. Major tasks of the project involved:  NCS developed a cloud-based digital twin for Melbourne Water that simulates the entire recycled water production process, integrating data from multiple platforms. This system is integrated with AI models and helps anticipate factors that could affect the production of recycled water, ensuring a more reliable supply and improving customer communication.    The digital twin provides three-day advance notice of critical turbidity levels, providing early warning to both operational teams and customers, as well as visibility about when recycled water production can resume. 
  
A Melbourne Water treatment plant. 
  As industrial and infrastructure environments become more digitally connected, the attack surface for OT systems is rapidly expanding. Unlike traditional IT environments, OT assets such as SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems, field sensors, and PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers)—were not originally designed with cyber threats in mind and often lack fundamental security controls.  In today’s regulatory and threat landscape, securing these systems is not optional—it is a critical imperative. The Australian Government’s Security of Critical Infrastructure (SOCI) Act mandates that operators of critical infrastructure implement and maintain risk management programs, including cybersecurity obligations. For many organisations, this means aligning their OT security strategies with recognised frameworks such as the Australian Energy Sector Cybersecurity Framework (AESCSF), the Essential Eight, and IEC 62443. Effective OT cybersecurity requires:  One industrial manufacturer, for example, enhanced its OT security posture by segmenting its network, deploying continuous monitoring tools, and establishing a centralised threat response protocol. These measures reduced incident response times by 40% and delivered a measurable uplift in overall cyber maturity. With both regulatory pressure and cyber threats intensifying, Australian organisations must act decisively. OT cybersecurity is no longer just about protecting operations  it’s about fulfilling national obligations and safeguarding critical infrastructure. 
  AI and digital twins offer measurable improvements in asset management:  The transformation is not limited to traditional utilities. ConX, a SaaS provider for construction contractors, illustrates the broader impact of cloud-native asset management. Partnering with NCS and Google Cloud, ConX reduced infrastructure costs by 70% and accelerated software release cycles by over 50%. With 99.99% uptime and BigQuery-powered analytics, the company now supports 2,500 users and is integrating machine learning to automate key tasks like plan take-offs.

  NCS recommends a phased framework. Organisations should:  AI is now actively reshaping asset-intensive operations, delivering value across the asset lifecycle, from predictive maintenance to generative knowledge systems.  In the following examples of work delivered by NCS, we share how our team has set a benchmark for excellence with delivering intelligent technology solutions and services for our clients. 
  At  , predictive analytics are being used to anticipate turbidity issues in recycled water networks up to three days in advance. Integrated with a digital twin platform, this system achieves 80% prediction accuracy and allows proactive interventions. 
  Likewise,   moved from reactive to predictive pump maintenance through machine learning, significantly reducing after-hours callouts by approximately 16 out-of-business-hour pump inspections and repairs per pump per year. 
  AI is being embedded into inspection systems. NCS worked with a   to integrate AI/ML models into its track monitoring process. Supported by MLOps pipelines, the system achieved over 90% accuracy in identifying rail defects, significantly reducing false positives and enabling timely preventive repairs. 
  Safety-critical industries are also seeing gains.   A   collaborated with NCS to roll out an AI-driven video monitoring platform across 750 cameras. With 11 embedded safety algorithms, the solution improved site inspections and compliance, reducing reliance on manual surveillance. 
  Foreign Object Debris (FOD) on runways can pose safety risks to airside operations. To enhance runway safety, NCS and Changi Airport Group co-developed the iFerret™ 2.0, an AI-powered FOD detection system. The system uses high-definition electro-optical sensors, real-time analytics, and machine learning to detect and verify FOD efficiently. It also provides automated alerts which enable the swift removal of FOD, ensuring minimal disruption to runway operations. Designed for 24/7 operations in various weather conditions, iFerret™ contributes to a safer and more efficient airside management. 
  Generative AI is also transforming knowledge access. Companies are deploying copilots that can retrieve inspection records, design documents and maintenance logs; help new employees onboard faster; and enable field staff to make informed decisions in real time. Some are even using AI to auto-generate work instructions and extract trends from historical data to improve operational consistency.  And in planning, generative models are beginning to simulate expansion or maintenance scenarios, evaluating impacts on service, cost and emissions, while automatically generating downstream tasks.  Executive Director and National Lead for Energy, Utilities and Resources, NCS Australia Share this article on: Experience boundless possibilities through our services: From AI-driven app development, tailored ICT solutions, and robust cybersecurity to Cloud-first transitions, data-driven insights, engaging digital experiences, infrastructure modernisation, and cutting-edge innovation.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  Across the energy, utilities and resources (EUR) industry, infrastructure assets are critical yet increasingly vulnerable. Aging systems, growing demand, and environmental disruptions are exposing the limits of traditional asset management, which has long relied on scheduled maintenance and historical failure data.  Modern challenges require smarter, integrated solutions – ones that can provide real-time visibility into asset health, enable predictive and prescriptive insights, and optimise maintenance and investment decisions. This shift demands reimagining systems and approaches, with cloud-based platforms, AI, and digital twins at the centre.  In Part 2 of our asset management whitepaper, we cover a framework for success, real-world applications and use cases for how AI is actively shaping asset-intensive operations and the transformative impact of GenAI. 
  As enterprise asset management becomes more digitally driven, EUR organisations are reaching a common inflection point: the need to modernise their systems of record. Legacy platforms like Maximo, Infor, Ellipse, and SAP – often heavily customised over time – must now evolve to meet the demands of connected, cloud-native operations.  Migrating to the cloud is not just a technical upgrade – it’s a strategic opportunity. Cloud-based Enterprise Asset Management (EAM) systems allow organisations to streamline outdated customisations, adopt current industry best practices, and reduce the burden of on-premise infrastructure. They also offer flexibility to scale services, connect seamlessly with mobile and geospatial systems, and serve as an integrated part of modern data platforms.  These modernised systems support real-time integrations with IoT devices, AI pipelines, and digital twins, turning the system of record into a system of insight. For example, when you move the Maximo system to the cloud, the transition will allow for adoption of IBM’s latest industry accelerators embedded in the latest version of the product, reduce technical debt, and embed predictive maintenance models. As a result, greater value can be delivered including improved work order automation, reduced maintenance backlog, and enhanced operational transparency. 
  AI has rapidly shifted from an opportunity to a necessity. Today, enterprises across the Asia-Pacific region are embracing AI not just for efficiency, but also for innovation, faster time to market, and revenue growth. NCS and IDC recently completed a study into AI and digital resilience. IDC projects regional AI spending will reach US$88 billion by 2027, growing at 28.2% annually.  While early adopters like Australia and Singapore continue to scale AI initiatives, 64% of organisations across the region are already using AI for targeted business use cases. Generative AI is gaining traction, but predictive and interpretive AI still account for 66% of enterprise AI budgets – reflecting the demand for practical, operational outcomes.  Adoption is not without its hurdles. Technology constraints, unclear use cases, data quality, and skills shortages remain top barriers. But organisations that invest strategically, aligning AI to business goals and building the right foundations, are realising real impact, from improved maintenance and operations to smarter customer and citizen services.  AI is no longer a siloed initiative. It is becoming core to how businesses in asset-intensive sectors deliver resilience, agility and long-term value.  This article is an extract from our whitepaper: The new era of asset intelligence: Cloud-connected, AI-driven, future-ready for energy, utilities and resources clients that unpacks how AI, digital twins, and cloud-native platforms are reshaping enterprise asset management.

                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  North East Water is a water utility company that provides water and sewage services to an estimated population of 110,000 people in 39 towns in North-East Victoria across an area of 20,000 square kilometres. The service delivery area is bound by Corryong, Yarrawonga, Benalla and Dartmouth. North East Water engaged Arq Group (ARQ; now  ), to solve the challenges they had been facing with their water networks sewer pumps operational efficiency through a custom digital twin solution.   NCS Australia has worked with North East Water to understand the key challenges they were facing with their sewer pumps operational efficiency. Summary of the key challenges: North East Water were looking to collaborate the existing asset management system to the cloud, to enable their front-line engineers to check the sewer pumps status from mobile devices and determine in advance where and when maintenance of individual pumps would be required. As a utility organisation aligned with the public sector, safely storing and transferring sensitive data is a key priority for North East Water. North East Water wanted to have their new cloud-based system running upon the existing supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) infrastructure so that the system integrity would be maintained and security compliant.  In the water utility industry, it can be challenging to proactively plan when to inspect pumps without any real time information on the pumps conditions. North East Water were facing this challenge and were only aware of issues with their sewer pumps after they had occurred. This resulted in the operation team being called out at all different hours to locate the problem and fix it at soon as possible. A team member from North East Water Wangaratta Operation stated “Sometimes I get called to check a pump, 10 minutes before my shift ends”. According to historic data the situation can sometimes be a lot worse with one of the sewer pumps breaking at 4am on Saturday.   NCS Australia has designed and worked with North East Water to provide an AWS based hybrid digital twin platform which will improve their water networks operational efficiency. The digital twin platform gets data from the existing supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data lake and brings the real-time data feed online in a safe and effective approach. The digital twin solution works closely with Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud platform, providing greater portability and accessibility by providing users access to the system anywhere, and on any device (below is an example of the digital twin platform design). 
  The core AWS components utilised in North East Water’s hybrid digital twin solution were: Through integrating machine learning into the digital twin system design, North East Water has tested the accuracy for advanced warnings of sewer pump failures, which will help them eliminate approximately 16 out-of-business-hour pump inspections and repairs per pump per year. By deploying the machine learning service on-premises, front-line engineers will be able to access the up-to-date asset status insights and the next best action, which will help them find and fix issues before they happen.   Through the partnership with NCS Australia, North East Water is now able to transfer and analyse sensitive data safely and effectively with their cloud-based digital twin system. This has enabled them to locate pump issues underground before they happen and update the asset inspection planning approach from an experience-driven to data-driven approach. This data driven approach significantly improves North East Water’s operational and resource efficiency and will help North East Water to reduce operating costs over time.   Share this article on: Acronis unifies data protection and cybersecurity, delivering cyber protection that solves

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  NCS helped Melbourne Water ensure a consistent and low-carbon method of providing quality water supply to the city’s 5 million inhabitants. This engagement employs machine learning and analytics to determine causes to poor quality of water supply and helps predict when supplies must be switched to maintain water quality. NCS enabled this cloud-based solution, using data from more than 700 tags to give up to an 80% prediction accuracy within 72 hours of the potential disruption. 
  Melbourne Water has responded to the need of more water supply with Class A recycled water. However, when the turbidity of water affects recycled water production, there is a lack of warning to the operation teams and customers. 
  NCS and its partner jointly created a cloud-based digital twin that models the end-to-end process of the recycled water production, aggregating data from across different platforms. This helps predict conditions that may impact the recycled water production, providing greater certainty for recycled water supply and improving customer communication. 
  The digital twin provides 3-day advanced warning or critical turbidity, providing early warning to operation teams and customers, as well as when recycled water production can resume. Share this article on: Thank you for your enquiry! We'll get back to you as soon we can.

ConX: Helping construction contractors quote faster and win work with Google Cloud : Helping construction contractors quote faster and win work with  Contact Us Thank you for your interest. Google Cloud Results A pivot to SaaS NCS optimised cloud A 70% reduction in costs 
                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:   deep understanding of Google Cloud enabled ConX to deliver a Saas-based service for building and construction contractors that enables 2,500 users to improve the efficiency of estimation and tender management and is poised to expand internationally and apply machine learning to improve the quality of its products. 
  - Reduces software development and release cycles 
- Delivers 99.99%+ uptime 
- Obtains deep insights into how customers use its products 
- Reduces infrastructure costs by 70% For small to medium contractors in building and construction, estimating jobs and managing the tendering process consumes time and resources better spent on profitable work. ConX provides software as a service tools that aim to help contractors manage the pre-construction, allowing them to quote on more jobs and ultimately win more work. Founded in 2015 as a boot-strapped part-time venture running a jobs board,   now offers three products as the basis of a still-in-development integrated pre-construction solution. These products are ConX Measure, a cloud-based tool that enables contractors to complete fast, accurate material take-offs (material quantities and costs required to complete a project); ConX Quote, a product that enables contractors to create simple quotes, featuring take-off information and other required information, in minutes, and a platform that enables builders to post tenders, connect with preferred subcontractors to obtain quotes, or post jobs in marketplaces for subcontractor bidding. “Our vision is to revolutionize the construction industry from the ground up with tools that are quick to adopt, easy to use, and cost-effective,” says Annie Slattery, Chief Executive Officer at ConX. “We pride ourselves on the simplicity of our products, because many tradespeople view technology almost as an afterthought when it is critical to their businesses.” 
  ConX pivoted to a SaaS model in early 2019, and Annie describes the move as a “game changer” that enabled the business to target international markets and step up development of ConX Measure. ConX now does about 20% of its business in the United States and Europe with the remaining 80% in Australia and New Zealand. Government measures to control the coronavirus pandemic prompted a 500% year-on-year growth in revenue in 2020, that Annie puts down to the designation of construction as an essential service and the more time people had to review demonstration videos and experiment with technology products. The business now provides its tools to 2,500 users. ConX trialled a few multinational cloud services before determining   was the best fit for its business. “We based our decision on three metrics: uptime, user experience, and price points,” explains Annie. “We had uptime issues due to a number of outages on one of our previous cloud providers—in fact, 4 AM calls advising us our system was down were commonplace.” 
  Annie and her fellow co-founders then engaged cloud managed services provider Riley to complete the migration and optimize its Google Cloud architecture. “Riley had team members experienced in DevOps and cloud and applied a 30-60-90 day plan to position us for success,” she explains. During the initial 30 day engagement, Riley reviewed the ConX business and provided advice about how to optimize cost and response speeds and track performance relative to metrics. Once Riley completed that program, its team worked with ConX to address larger issues, such as bot infiltration of the signup process for its software and reducing the impact of large files incorporating detailed architectural plans being uploaded to the service. ConX and Riley completed the move to Google Cloud on September 1, 2020, with the business building, testing, and deploying with the Buildkite CI/CD platform to a containerized application environment orchestrated by the   open source system. The business uses   to run its relational database and   to enable the analysis of data from multiple sources. “The BigQuery data warehouse helps us understand how customers are using our products so we can identify trends and opportunities to improve the experience,” says Annie. 
  Annie describes her four-person development team as “much happier” since the move to Google Cloud, with team members working to integrate its products into the Google ecosystem. The business has reduced its cloud costs by 70%, lowering its monthly spend without sacrificing customer experience. Furthermore, the ability to cost-effectively deploy multiple staging servers and undertake branching has reduced software development and release cycles by 50%–60%. “With Google Cloud, we also eliminated the outages that compromised customer service, giving us a sound platform from which to build a truly international business,” says Annie. Overall, Google Cloud positions ConX to realize its ambition of providing a consistent service to customers regardless of location. Furthermore, ConX can explore opportunities to build machine learning into its products to automate tasks such as the detection of scale and boundary surface areas for construction contractors and the recognition and counting of material items marked as an icon on the construction plan, improving the speed and accuracy of estimations. “Google Cloud presents an opportunity to take ourselves to the next level, and moving to the platform has been a really positive move for us,” concludes Annie.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  Customer-owned banks have long been trusted pillars in Australian communities, offering an alternative to the ‘Big Four’. But in an era of digital-first banking, smaller institutions face a growing challenge: How can a customer-owned bank deliver competitive digital customer experiences with fewer resources than a major bank? 
 
While   banks may not be able to match the scale or spend of their larger rivals, they can compete - and win - by doubling down on their unique strengths and making targeted investments in digital experience. In this update, Greg Barnett, Digital Experience Director, NCS, and Andrew Carr, Financial Services Director, NCS, explore the challenges, opportunities, and practical moves key decision makers at customer-owned banks can make to support their institution succeeding in a digital world. 
  The leading banks in Australia have invested heavily in digital transformation, user experience (UX) design, and AI-driven personalisation. Their apps are feature-rich, frictionless, and deeply integrated across services. In contrast, many COBA banks are still grappling with: This disparity can create a digital experience gap - where customer expectations shaped by major banks clash with the reality of more constrained offerings from smaller ones. Scale isn’t everything – COBA banks bring strengths that big banks can’t easily replicate: Unlike listed banks that must constantly balance customer needs with quarterly profit demands, COBA banks are owned by their customers. This means they can prioritise value over volume, invest in long-term trust-building, and design digital services with customer wellbeing - not just revenue growth - at the centre. 
 
These attributes create an opening: COBA banks don’t need to match big-bank digital experiences feature-for-feature. They can focus on delivering meaningful, frictionless, and human-centred journeys in the areas that matter most to their customers. So, what can COBA banks do to close the gap – five key approaches include:  Rather than spreading investment thinly, COBA banks can identify the 3–5 most critical customer experiences (e.g., account opening, payments, loan applications) and make them exceptional. Use techniques like design sprints and rapid prototyping to co-create these with customers. Many smaller banks are finding success with part-time specialists, shared UX resources, or external consultants embedded in key projects. 
 
Importantly, working with the right external consultants can have a secondary benefit: It brings fresh energy, exposes internal teams to modern practices, and acts as a catalyst for building internal capability over time. This hands-on collaboration often helps shift culture, upskill staff, and embed a more design-led, customer-centric mindset across the institution. 
 
What's essential is remaining focused on putting customer needs at the heart of product and service design, whether the work is done in-house or with trusted partners. Smaller banks don’t have to build everything in-house. Leveraging fintech partnerships, shared service platforms, or COBA-wide initiatives can accelerate innovation. Consider modular, API-based platforms that allow you to modernise customer experiences even on legacy cores. Big banks may have armies of data scientists. But even small banks can use customer data to personalise communication, functionality, pre-fill forms, or automate follow-ups. Small wins here can have outsised customer impact. Reinvesting in the community isn’t just good citizenship – it can give your team a strategic advantage. Initiatives like those run by  , which invested over $6 million in community programs in a single year, build brand trust and deepen customer loyalty. For member-owned banks, these efforts reinforce the idea that customers are not just users of the service – they’re owners and beneficiaries. Done right, community investment becomes part of the experience strategy, not just the corporate social responsibility strategy. COBA banks may not outspend the majors, but they can out-listen, out-care, and out-focus them. With smart prioritisation, lightweight design and tech capability, and a clear focus on what their customers truly value, customer-owned banks can deliver modern digital experiences – without losing what makes them different. 
 
The opportunity isn’t to replicate the big banks. It’s to differentiate with purpose, and use digital to enhance – not replace – the human connection that’s always set COBA banks apart. At NCS, our team are deeply committed to delivering value for our clients, and we are adaptive to your needs. We understand the challenges that matter to COBA banks – and can help your team succeed in a competitive market.  Our experienced consultants get people – we understand what it takes to help your team create digital customer experiences that deliver a ‘wow’ factor for your customers with technology services that hit the mark, delivering value for money.  Curious?

The app's development involved customer research and design-led experience approach and resulted in custom iOS and Android native mobile applications connected to core systems via .NET API hosted on Azure APIM. The entire process, from concept to launch, took only six months. 
  When UniSuper started their journey, their vision was so much more than just feature parity with their rivals. Instead, they planned to reinvigorate, reinvent and rethink the experience of superannuation apps. In an industry sometimes considered boring and stuck within the status quo, UniSuper wanted to make their application a joyful experience, inclusive and accessible to everyone, revitalising their customer’s engagement and attitude towards their super. Having just celebrated their 40th anniversary, UniSuper is steeped in tradition. A bold change like this required UniSuper to adapt its approach to become more agile, it required buy-in and belief from its leaders, a desire and willingness to challenge current expectations of superannuation apps, and a partner who could build and deliver this project. Success was dependent on a deep partnership between UniSuper and NCS. Utilising UniSuper’s knowledge and experience in superannuation, and passion for their customers, and NCS’s long history in developing innovative mobile apps. With this being the first native app release for UniSuper, the client and internal teams were uncertain of the constraints and nuances of an app-led experience, meaning that they had to work closely in partnership to ensure both teams clearly understood the direction in which the app would proceed. The project brief was to leapfrog the superannuation competition by doing something new - creating an app that delighted its users and breathing a breath of fresh air to the pockets of their more than 620,000 users. 
  In an industry with so many different providers, innovation can be difficult. As a result, the desire for an application that would bring delight needed deep thought to challenge the status quo and shake up the industry. UniSuper approached this challenge with a change in mindset, rethinking superannuation instead of following in the footsteps of others. Historically a superannuation application would replicate the web functionality. UniSuper based their decisions on research to challenge this assumption by understanding how people’s relationships differ between the web and their phones, and how they could maximise the impact of each piece of functionality in their initial application offering. The game changer was human centred design, understanding their user base, listening to their experience, and designing the entire application from scratch with user experience at the heart of everything they did. Rethinking the experience yielded incredible results with subtle changes refreshing previously tired functionality. UniSuper understood that research, coupled with technical architecture and design was the key to get it right before writing the first lines of code. The key underpinning foundation was accessibility. When you design for everyone then everyone reaps the benefits. With NCS’s industry leading experience in the accessibility space they could understand how these concepts could seamlessly fit into the foundations of the project. This was the final measure of success for the UniSuper team - that everyone would be able to use this application, with an optimised experience, no matter who they are. 
   : Newcastle Permanent Building Society With so many superannuation providers in Australia it would be easy to assume they each face the same problems - the opposite couldn’t be closer to the truth. Due to differences in age, demographic, gender, industry and many other factors, each fund needs to carefully consider the best experience for their members. For older Australians, a superannuation application has direct implications on their day to day life, rather than their far off future. The right design and user flow would give members an immediate and direct connection to their finances. Giving reassurance and information clearly and quickly. Unisuper wanted to ensure the app was able to support all digitally engaged members from Day 1, regardless of whether they were just beginning their super journey or into their retirement phase. The UniSuper design team owned this concept, undertaking research, designing, testing, receiving feedback, and repeating the process until a striking, engaging and intuitive result was uncovered. This clear and easy-to-use layout has positive flow on effects to the entire customer base, guiding all users through the process to stay connected and engaged with their retirement funds. The stereotype of the older demographic is of people who struggle to use and understand technology. The new UniSuper application turns this on its head. With careful consideration, time and expertise UniSuper have received no app related calls to its call centre, showing that the problem might lie at the feet of the technologists, rather than their users. 
  UniSuper knew that its users were at the heart of success for this new mobile platform. Understanding their needs, how they would use the app and how that experience could be improved was vital in building the right product six months before its release. Although design is at the heart of user experience, almost equally important is the responsiveness and architecture of a mobile application - with loading times, crash rates and network errors having a huge impact on how people feel when they put their phones back in their pockets. UniSuper and NCS worked together to ensure the final product exceeded user expectations. The app's responsiveness was exceptional, with an average response time of 2,652 milliseconds from over 3.7 million Australian requests. The app was stable with almost 100% uptime and was crash-free on Android and 99.5% crash-free on iOS. Users were highly satisfied with the app, as reflected in their ratings and feedback. The app received 4.7 stars from 1.1K reviews on iOS and 4.7 stars from 400 reviews on Android. The design was praised for being seamless, inclusive, and intuitive. Since its release, the app has seen exponential growth, with mobile accounting for 48% of all logins. The app's success has also led to an increase in active users, with the desktop members being more active. The app has received over 95k downloads, exceeding original targets. 
  UniSuper treats cyber security and digital member safety as one of its top priorities and the company has built its products around this core pillar. UniSuper's technical specialists and leaders understand the importance of people's information and have baked cyber security into the fabric of their new mobile application. The new application is designed with a range of features to ensure maximum privacy and security. All user information is securely stored and requires authentication to access and perform key functions. UniSuper has also implemented several small but powerful security features that ensure the highest level of privacy. The security measures of UniSuper extend beyond the user-facing application. The company has put in place stringent measures to ensure the security of requests to fetch user data, information delivery, and the backend where all the information is stored within Australia. UniSuper recognises that security is not a one-time thing, and hence, security is their top priority even in the ongoing development and improvement stage of the application. The company is constantly designing and reviewing code to meet its exceptionally high standard and keep up with the ever-changing landscape of security.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  As champions for the financial wellbeing of its members and the community, The Mutual Bank has been serving local communities in Maitland and the Hunter Valley in New South Wales since 1888.  As a proud member of the Community Owned Banking Association (COBA), for 130 years The Mutual Bank has continually evolved to meet the changing needs of its members and communities. To do that, the Bank is committed to embracing digital and technology advancements. By leveraging NCS’s technology services expertise and adopting Microsoft Fabric as their strategic data platform, The Mutual Bank eliminated data silos, reduced duplication, and established a trusted single source of truth to drive sustainable growth and innovation.   Common fact: Data provides a foundation to identify opportunity, improve efficiency and gain a competitive edge. Data is an enabler for strategic planning, understanding customer needs, and developing better products and services.  What The Mutual Bank didn’t lack was data, most of which was stored in their core banking system. Previously, accessing and manipulating that data was a time-consuming, technical, and labour-intensive process, which still required a lot of cleaning up and reformatting before the data could be shared and used for insights and analytics.   What they needed was a modern data infrastructure to drive their strategic objectives.  Specifically, the Bank was striving to: The Mutual Bank’s main question was: How could they drive a data-driven decision-making culture and ensure their data infrastructure could scale to meet future needs?  
  Together we delivered a transformation initiative to demonstrate The Mutual Bank’s commitment to innovation and growth, and, at the same time, directly benefit its members through improved services, more personalised banking experiences, quicker response times, and more accurate information.  NCS and The Mutual Bank enhanced data quality, ensured secure and timely data integration, and continue to foster a data-driven decision-making culture across the organisation through self-serve analytics.  While the intention was to move fast, powered by Microsoft’s Fabric Platform, the solution focused on showcasing business use cases designed to deliver immediate value, while driving early adoption of a data-driven approach.  A comprehensive solution was implemented incorporating these key components: The new and modern platform built on Microsoft Fabric in the cloud will enable regular business, finance and operational staff to access data, interrogate it, easily build dashboards to drive business insights, and inform critical business decisions in a timely manner.  This solution not only resolved immediate challenges but also laid the foundation for a data-driven culture across the business, ensuring alignment with the Bank’s new Digital, Technology and Data Strategy. 
    NCS helped The Mutual Bank to democratise their data, setting up the platform to allow it to be used by the people who need it, to make the decisions that matter; but importantly to do this in a way that is secure, well governed and meets regulatory compliance and data privacy requirements.  When The Mutual Bank was looking for a seasoned Microsoft partner to guide their Cloud and Data transformation journey, they found NCS. Leveraging our specialised data expertise and strong Microsoft partnership, our collaboration created a foundation for a long-term strategic alliance. This alliance positions The Mutual Bank for scalable innovation.   By adopting Microsoft Fabric as the foundation of their modern data platform, they’re eliminating silos, reducing duplication, and ensuring a trusted single source of truth that empowers better decision-making and drives sustainable growth.  When you successfully combine people and process with technology as the enabler, all aimed at meeting strategic objectives – that’s how transformation becomes tangible.

                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  With responsibility for managing the retirement savings of 1.8 million members, Hostplus recognised that its original mobile app was not fit-for-purpose for its diverse membership base and there was improvement potential across the entire platform – design, experience, performance and data. NCS Australia was tasked to provide a new era of digital experience for its members and to redevelop Hostplus’ mobile app, the preferred channel for its members to engage with their superannuation. The end result has been an award-winning app that brings broad benefits for Hostplus’ members. Hostplus was recognised as a Gold winner in the 2025 World Design Awards, 2025 Australian Design Awards and 2024 Melbourne Design Awards for this mobile app redesign project, drawing on knowledge and technical experience from both NCS Australia and its own team. Since the app redesign, NCS Australia has continued working with Hostplus to develop new features for the app that add value and provide practical benefits for Hostplus’ members.   
  Enhancing the user experience to deliver better outcomes for members was a primary driver of the project. Hostplus’ young demographic made the need to enhance the user experience particularly acute and drove demand for a more fit-for-purpose digital offering. However, the solution also needed to provide for the requirements of retirees. 
 
Compounding the challenge was Hostplus’ reliance on legacy technology, stifling the ability to innovate or deliver at speed. 
 
The project and outcomes needed to represent value for members. Hostplus understood a usual application baseline for success would not be enough. Highly responsive, low crash rates, accessible, and fast would be the foundation and not the pinnacle. They needed a seamless migration from the old app to the new – with Hostplus committed to no members being logged out during the upgrade – while linking design and branding so members would intuitively know how to use it. All of this was no small feat, particularly factoring in the ‘security first’ mindset Hostplus bring to every aspect of their development and release lifecycle. 
  The work focused on incorporating intuitive and accessible design, with flexible architecture in transitioning from an outdated Xamarin mobile framework to using native application platforms. Ensuring high performance and first-class security were embedded, with ongoing improvements in speed possible, was also important. 
 
User experience and application security was at the core of every development and design decision, with the team focused on leveraging technical best practices to ensure a secure, extensible, scalable, high-quality app, with experience design applied to create an engaging user experience focused on education and improving member outcomes. 
 
Accessibility was a critical aspect in the design of the app, ensuring that all members can navigate and use the app with ease. The result is an enhanced user experience, which will not only have a positive impact for Australians living with a disability, but all users of the app, with improved design, layout and flow. 
 
Finally, cross-channel consistency enhances the app, ensuring the strong Hostplus brand is presented across both digital and non-digital channels, which is key to building trust, maintaining brand integrity and ensuring member confidence in every interaction. 
 
Delivery was achieved within six months and on budget, creating a strong foundation for the addition of expanded features in the future. 
  The release of the redeveloped Hostplus app signals the start of a new era in digital experience for its members. The redesigned app offers secure access to account information, balances and investment options with ease. The development was informed by member research and design principles, ensuring a digital experience that sets the app apart. A strong working relationship between the teams has been  , with the app recognised as a Gold winner in the  ,   and   in the Digital – Finance category. These awards provide industry recognition to celebrate where technology and innovation are nurturing extraordinary design, with the Digital – Finance category considering apps and sites disrupting sectors such as mobile payments, money transfers, loans, fundraising and financial management. “NCS and Hostplus have formed a true partnership – with both companies including team members who are passionate about superannuation and technology, with a common goal of achieving great results,” said Jules Barnes, Specialist Practices Lead, NCS Australia. “The relationship has been formed on trust, honesty and a desire to achieve member-focused outcomes, with a safe environment to question what is assumed, and a commitment to deliver once decisions have been made. “Delivery for this app was achieved within six months and on budget, creating a strong foundation for the addition of expanded features long term. The mobile app development was informed by member research and design principles, ensuring a digital experience that sets the app apart.” The Hostplus app meets the diverse needs of its members. An intuitive interface, with a focus on education, allows for easy account management for members at any life stage. The app’s inclusive design has been a key factor in its success, ensuring it resonates with a wide demographic The app launch was successful for Hostplus. Automated testing resulted in a 0.02% crash rate on iOS and a 0.07% crash rate on Android. Seamless integration, faster loading times and enhanced security have delivered 94% growth in app access year-on-year, more than three times greater sentiment – based on reviews and mentions on social – and a 4.5 Apple star rating. Hostplus has also seen engagement rise, with the median number of logins per member increasing by 30% when comparing the three months pre-and post-launch.

                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  In today’s digital world, most organisations have embraced the use of technology to deliver business value. From developing IT solutions’ perspective, there is a need to deliver these applications in the shortest possible time so that businesses can quickly reap the benefits of technology and get a head start over their competitors. To develop these applications, multiple groups have to work together. The development process involves the conceptualisation of the end product, building minimum viable product and finally through iterative process, to develop the product. To reduce the cost of development, organisations often adopt offshoring practices and product principles to guide and assist them in their review of the development.  Developers, product owners and other partners thus have to come together and collaborate across multiple geographical locations and time zones. For such a collaboration to deliver objectives within tight schedules, IT organisations will need to adopt standardised delivery processes and use efficient platform that will help accelerate the development.  Platforms play an important role in enabling collaborative development.  They provide a practical approach to address the challenges involved in development: In current circumstances, such platforms will be even more important as they provide secure collaborative environments for teams that may not be able to meet up physically, even though they may be in the same geographical location. Pre-built dashboards can help address the management challenges involved in a distributed development scenario where software may be developed in one country, hardware built in another, and testing carried out in a third. Such dashboards will enable teams to track work progress across the different locations and generate the relevant reports. For example, they can help project managers to monitor the progress across different development zones, while programme managers can monitor the overall programme status across different geographies. Effective dashboard provides: * Overall status of the programme 
* Status of specific projects and the development status 
* Ability to zoom into development activities within specific projects to look at sprint level  
     information 
* Ability to understand the status of user stories and the dependencies, and the impact to 
     project schedules Development platforms should have the capability to spin off development environments based on customer’s choice of cloud provider. Automated management of infrastructure includes provisioning, patch management, and hardening to customers’ specific standards and product requirements.    The use of tools in application development leads to quality outcomes because they enforce standardisation. Adoption of DevSecOps tools will pave the way for: * An effective and standardised branching strategy for the applications that are being developed 
* Automated deployment of codes to the provisioned environment 
* Effective tracking of deliverables and recording of issues that are reported 
* Gamification to introduce a competitive element into the developer community 
* Identification of code quality issues early in the development process 
* Secure coding by incorporating best practices in DAST, SAST, IAST With a project that is distributed and managed across multiple locations, the ability to understand project data and make timely management decision is of paramount importance. This will help avoid schedule and cost overruns. It is therefore important for the development platform to be smart. This means having the capability to get data from multiple touchpoints to enable * Effective work assignments 
* Timely escalation with information on corrective actions 
* Correlation of data points to provide insights into event dependencies and  possible alternatives 
* Identification of project risks using data points collected from the DevSecOps tools Development platforms provide a practical approach to addressing the challenges of distributed development and ensuring successful project delivery. They help ensure that projects are completed on time, whilst meeting the requirements of application quality and stability. This is achieved by supporting collaboration amongst stakeholders; ensuring standardisation through the use of tools; enabling rapid deployment of development environments with the capability to manage and monitor them; and increasing productivity through the adoption of tools, best practices and gamification.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  NCS helped StudyLink Connect, Australia’s leading cloud-based international admissions solution provider, achieve optimal cloud cost savings that allowed the company to continuously grow and innovate without disruptions. StudyLink Connect has seen a steady rise in their cloud usage and costs on AWS platform over the past 3 years. Their engineering team was tasked to investigate optimising their costs effectively, with the aim of reducing wastage and identifying underutilised assets. However, this was highly time-consuming and they needed to quickly identify areas for cost savings on a continuous basis. 
 
In order for them to stay competitive and deliver the best experiences to customers, StudyLink Connect required a single dashboard to view all their operational data in their cloud consumption so the team can instantly assess, interpret and take action to control costs, while focusing on continued innovation. NCS NEXT Cloud FinOps used their expertise and familiarity with the AWS environment to add value to StudyLink Connect’s engineering team. This helped to reduce StudyLink Connect’s cloud costs through their expert recommendations delivered via custom reports, asset visibility and continued cost governance, which included: 
 
  Within 30 days of the engagement kick-off, StudyLink Connect's monthly cost was reduced by a staggering 19%. StudyLink Connect's cloud optimisation journey goes beyond short-term savings. Following the optimisation exercise, NCS NEXT Cloud FinOps continues to monitor cloud cost and usage with automated policies, while preparing the team to adopt a FinOps Operating Model. This ensures their cloud environment remains optimised in anticipation of their future growth.

As opposed to only optimising after completion of a project, an iterative approach accounts for changing factors in demand, service availability and your own business goals. Establish a process of analysis, budgeting and improvement to ensure you stay in a cost-optimised state. To maximise your savings, consider: 1. Removing and consolidating unused or unattached instances. These often accumulate when testing, migrating or closing services. Run a complete analysis of your instance-by-instance costs and usage metrics to identify services that can be closed without impact. 2. Right-sizing over-provisioned services. Cloud providers bill the full amount regardless of the actual usage. Reduce excessive instance sizes and migrate to more efficient families, matching supply and demand. Cost analytics tools can help identify wasteful service selections and lead you towards an optimal environment. 3. Taking advantage of alternative payment models with your cloud provider. You can accumulate significant long-term savings by committing to services.   The NCS FinOps team provides a cloud financial management service, powered by the NCS FinOps platform and FinOps certified practitioners, to provide cloud financial management advice on AWS, Azure and GCP. NCS was one of the first organisations in Australia to offer Cloud Financial Management services and has multiple clients across government, healthcare, insurance, retail, utilities and education sectors. 
 
Our strategy is to offer services that support clients through their cloud financial management journey ranging from immediate cost reduction needs, to proactive (e.g. cost avoidance and anomaly detection) and strategic needs provided through our FinOps advisory services.  Following our cost optimisation framework, this 4-6 week engagement is targeted at the needs of clients who have an urgent and immediate requirement to identify cost savings in their environment. Within 2-3 weeks an interim report will be provided that identifies non-intrusive initiatives that can be implemented for immediate realisation of savings. A comprehensive report will be provided at the conclusion of the engagement. 
  
  Our second service is a continuous and proactive Cloud Financial Management service. This service is underpinned by 3 pillars to help clients reduce and control costs within their environment: 
        We work closely with clients to actively reduce costs as projects architectures progress through the entire lifecycle. Our technical experts explore all possible optimisations and transform them into actionable cost-savings recommendations. Our optimization frameworks and proprietary tools allow us to uncover savings beyond what is offered through cloud native trusted advisor tools. As an Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) partner, we also track the latest service and pricing updates to keep your environment efficient and evergreen. We encourage visibility and data-driven decision making. We take the responsibility of cost optimisation off your team, allowing you to focus on what your business does best.   Share this article on: Thank you for your enquiry!

                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  In the ever-evolving landscape of technology, Microsoft has consistently positioned itself at the forefront of innovation. With the introduction of Copilot M365 and Copilot Studio, Microsoft AI is reshaping the way we approach productivity and creativity. These cutting-edge tools harness the power of artificial intelligence to provide users with unprecedented levels of assistance, efficiency, and creativity in their daily tasks. This article explores the value of Microsoft AI through the lenses of Copilot M365 and Copilot Studio, highlighting how these tools are transforming the modern workspace.   The Copilot M365 is an AI-driven assistant seamlessly integrated within Microsoft 365 applications. This powerful tool leverages machine learning and natural language processing to enhance productivity by simplifying complex tasks and providing intelligent suggestions. 
  One of the primary benefits of Copilot M365 is its ability to streamline workflows. By analysing user behaviour and understanding context, Copilot can predict the next steps, automate repetitive tasks, and provide relevant information precisely when it is needed. This reduces the cognitive load on users, allowing them to focus on more strategic and creative aspects of their work. 
  Copilot M365 offers contextual assistance that goes beyond simple task automation. It can provide real-time suggestions for improving documents, generating insights from data, and even drafting emails. For instance, when working on a presentation in PowerPoint, Copilot can suggest design elements, relevant content, and even layout options based on the context of the slides. This not only saves time but also ensures that the output is of high quality. 
  In today's interconnected world, collaboration is key to success. Copilot M365 enhances collaboration by facilitating seamless communication and coordination among team members. It can summarize meeting notes, track action items, and even generate reports from collaborative documents. This ensures that everyone is on the same page and that nothing falls through the cracks.   While Copilot M365 focuses on productivity, Copilot Studio is designed to unlock creativity. This innovative tool empowers users to bring their ideas to life with the help of AI-driven suggestions and enhancements. 
  Copilot Studio serves as a wellspring of creative inspiration. Whether you're working on a design project, writing a story, or composing music, Copilot Studio can provide suggestions, templates, and even generate content based on your inputs. For instance, a graphic designer can receive suggestions for colour schemes, typography, and layout, while a writer can get prompts and ideas to overcome writer's block. 
  Copilot Studio takes content creation to the next level by offering AI-enhanced tools. For example, it can automatically generate captions for images, create realistic simulations for design prototypes, and even compose melodies for musical compositions. This not only accelerates the creative process but also ensures that the output is polished and professional. 
  One of the standout features of Copilot Studio is its ability to provide personalised experiences. By understanding user preferences and learning from their interactions, Copilot Studio tailors its suggestions and enhancements to suit individual needs. This results in a more intuitive and enjoyable creative process, where users feel supported and inspired.   The true value of Microsoft AI lies in the synergy between Copilot M365 and Copilot Studio. By bridging the gap between productivity and creativity, these tools create a holistic environment where users can excel in both domains. 
  The seamless integration of Copilot M365 and Copilot Studio within the Microsoft ecosystem ensures that users can effortlessly switch between tasks and applications. This interconnectedness allows for a fluid workflow where productivity enhancements and creative suggestions are always within reach. 
  Both Copilot M365 and Copilot Studio leverage data-driven insights to provide relevant and accurate assistance. By analysing vast amounts of data and learning from user interactions, these tools can anticipate needs, predict outcomes, and offer valuable recommendations. This data-driven approach ensures that users receive the most pertinent and actionable information. 
  The transformative impact of Microsoft AI is evident in the way it empowers users to achieve more in less time. By automating mundane tasks, providing intelligent suggestions, and enhancing creative outputs, Copilot M365 and Copilot Studio free up valuable time and mental resources. This allows users to focus on higher-value activities, drive innovation, and achieve their goals more efficiently.   As a Microsoft partner, NCS Australia has enabled customers to realise the benefits of Copilot. ,  Share this article on: Acronis unifies data protection and cybersecurity, delivering cyber protection that solves

                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  , now an NCS company, worked with a major telecommunication provider to solve the challenges they had been facing with automating their product pricing process for mobility solution sales through a custom Microsoft PowerApps solution. In the telecommunication industry, price plays an important role in the consumer purchasing decision process. Therefore, it’s essential that telecommunication providers have access to efficient financial modelling tools to be able to swiftly price products and react to competitor pricing changes. Our Microsoft solutions team worked with the major telecommunication provider to understand the key challenges they were facing with automating their product pricing process for mobility solution sales. We saw that the organisation was using a spreadsheet-based tool for financial modelling which required numerous manual platforms and spreadsheets to assess the commercial impacts of pricing changes and deals. Subsequently, this resulted in a lack of visibility on the status of pricing changes and made it more difficult for employees to quickly price products. In addition, we understood the clients’ need to automate the pricing process for mobility solution sales with a custom pricing application, reducing time, costs, and the possibility of errors. The automation was particularly important to the client as they had attempted this twice before with no success. We successfully delivered a custom pricing application for our client in only six months using Microsoft PowerApps, which enabled the telecommunication provider to complete all pricing changes and assessments for mobility solution sales in one platform. This solution was delivered in two phases. In the Proof-of-Concept phase, we collaboratively worked with the telecommunication provider to streamline their data processes and deliver a proof of concept for one of their four product portfolios using Microsoft PowerApps. The proof of concept was a great way to showcase the capabilities of Microsoft PowerApps and demonstrate how it could meet the pricing requirements of the telecommunication provider. The success of the proof of concept enabled us to proceed with the full delivery scope for the other products. The delivery plan was executed in fortnightly sprints to optimise efficiency and enable key stakeholder feedback. We were able to successfully deliver the custom pricing application for all four-product portfolios in six months using Microsoft PowerApps. Through a partnership with  , an NCS company, the major telecommunication provider has been able to automate their pricing process and improve the speed and efficiency to which they can make pricing changes for mobility solution sales. Additionally, they can now easily generate reports to swiftly identify the impacts of pricing changes. 
  
Operationally this has enabled the organisation to increase their speed to market with pricing changes for mobility solution sales, save costs and maximise resource efficiency. Share this article on: Acronis unifies data protection and cybersecurity, delivering cyber protection that solves

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  The Central Land Council (CLC) is a Commonwealth corporate entity governed by the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976. CLC operates through various legal entities, overseeing corporate and financial responsibilities while ensuring the efficient distribution of funds to Aboriginal associations and their members. Seeking to enhance transparency and reporting accuracy, CLC needed a user-friendly system capable of generating precise reports swiftly. 
 
Furthermore, the management of operational overheads and payments posed a critical concern, requiring a solution offering comprehensive visibility across all aspects of operations and the flexibility to grow with the business's evolving requirements, all while being customisable. 
  NCS has successfully taken over support for Microsoft Dynamics NAV for CLC when requested and is currently in the process of upgrading Dynamics NAV  to the latest version of Dynamics 365 Business Central Online. Concurrently, NCS is collaborating with CLC to introduce enhancements through the Power Platform, seeking to streamline and optimize the process of capturing expenses and travel requests for increased efficiency. 
  Through the implemented system, CLC has achieved comprehensive visibility and control across all facets of its operations. The introduction of workflows has not only added a layer of governance and spending control but has also significantly enhanced the visibility and traceability of financial processes. As a result, CLC can now dedicate more time and attention to their core business activities and daily tasks, assured of their financial management and operational efficiency, all simultaneously.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  The Queensland Aboriginal and Islander Health Council faced a pressing challenge in the form of an outdated and inefficient financial system that hindered their ability to adapt to the evolving needs of their organization. Additionally, as a not-for-profit entity with government responsibilities, they required a financial solution that could provide insights, best practices, and a deep understanding of their financial operations to optimize their processes effectively. The need for scalability and flexibility to accommodate the potential expansion of their system to other council members added another layer of complexity to this challenge. Overcoming these hurdles while maintaining their commitment to quality healthcare services was paramount to their mission. 
  To address these challenges, the Queensland Aboriginal and Islander Health Council partnered with NCS Australia, a trusted Microsoft Business Partner. NCS Australia implemented Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central, a comprehensive financial management solution known for its scalability and adaptability. In addition, NCS Australia introduced their tailor-made Payfocus payroll system, providing a holistic and integrated financial solution to streamline operations, enhance financial insights, and facilitate seamless expansion within the organisation. 
  The implementation of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central and the integration of NCS Australia's Payfocus payroll system have yielded profound positive impacts for the Queensland Aboriginal and Islander Health Council. They now enjoy a highly efficient financial system that empowers informed decision-making and enhances operational agility. Furthermore, the newfound scalability and flexibility have positioned the organization for sustainable growth, making it easier to extend these benefits to other members within their council, ultimately fostering a stronger foundation for delivering critical healthcare services.

They provide programs relating to health, disabilities, child safety, families, mental health and more. Itec has been working on many siloed systems and accordingly, visibility of activity across the organisation is difficult to ascertain. They have embarked on a program to move to the Microsoft platform, including Business Central and various Power Platform products.  The most critical component in the short term was the payroll.   The current payroll was expensive to run and was not providing consistency or accuracy.  Much manual intervention was required.   The old Payroll was due for annual renewal. The NCS PayFocus was selected to replace the existing payroll. As staff is in short supply Dialog was appointed to implement a payroll specific to the requirements of the ITEC Group and then to maintain and run the payroll on behalf of ITEC. The project was completed within three weeks. ITEC was no longer dependent on an outdated and legacy payroll team, was able to get a solution specific to their needs.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  Founded in 1935, Radio Parts is a prominent Melbourne-based distributor of electronics and components, with its headquarters in West Melbourne. The company serves over 9,000 clients through a dedicated team of six on-the-road sales representatives. Formerly, Radio Parts utilized a highly customized, outdated on-premises software system, which posed challenges as it was a closed platform requiring extensive customizations for third-party integrations. The system lacked key features, had no upgrade path, and limited integration options, leading Radio Parts to rely on a specific e-commerce solution. 
  NCS Australia analysed existing operations and introduced an integrated solution that includes Dynamics 365 Business Central, NCS Payfocus, Power BI, and an embedded Point of Sale system. Integration with Radio Parts' E-Commerce platform was facilitated through native Business Central API, while Power Automate streamlines data transfers to multiple sales channels, and Power BI offers robust visual reporting. 
  Previously, Radio Parts grappled with the constraints of on-premises software and intricate scripting to extract and integrate data. However, a transformative shift occurred as Radio Parts transitioned to a state-of-the-art cloud platform, liberating itself from local network dependencies. This transition facilitated seamless interconnectivity among all software components, ensuring that they consistently operate on the most up-to-date versions. “

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  Australians love going to the movies, from watching the highs and lows of powerful films to pairing the buttery crunch of popcorn with an indulgent choc top as they experience the wonder of the big screen. As a trusted Cloud Services technology provider, NCS Australia has signed a five-year deal with HOYTS for managed services for their digital channel, including a   Azure hyperscale service tier and use of Cloudflare, the world’s first connectivity cloud. HOYTS is one of the world’s leading entertainment companies, operating over 60 cinemas across Australia and New Zealand, with more than 500 screens and over 60,000 seats across the network. Today, HOYTS is the largest single-brand movie exhibitor in Australia and New Zealand. Each year, HOYTS welcomes millions of guests into their cinemas to enjoy the latest movies and special event presentations. With this in mind, being able to deliver a seamless and frictionless experience is of utmost importance. From the moment movie lovers tap "Buy tickets," the magic of cinema begins. HOYTS' digital gateway isn't just about transactions – it's where the anticipation of movie night takes flight. Gone are the days of rushing to secure seats or wondering if your favourite showing might sell out. Today's savvy moviegoers are embracing the freedom to lock in their perfect viewing experience with just a few clicks.  Behind this seamless experience stands NCS Australia, orchestrating every digital ticket purchase. The NCS Australia team is powering the technology to ensure each transaction flows smoothly, letting moviegoers focus on what really matters – whether to go for the large or extra-large popcorn (and if they should pair their popcorn with a choc top).  For HOYTS, their online ticketing system isn't just convenient – it's mission-critical. Even a brief system hiccup can send ripples through their operations, potentially costing them more than just ticket sales. It's why they've made rock-solid reliability their non-negotiable standard, ensuring the show goes on.  The five-year Hosted Managed Services deal encompasses:        In the competitive landscape of modern entertainment, HOYTS faced a classic technical dilemma: How to build and maintain a digital infrastructure that could not only handle extreme traffic spikes, but also optimise revenue during quieter periods. The stakes for inaction are high – every millisecond of downtime can mean lost ticket sales, customer frustration, and potential brand reputation damage.  “Our wealth of experience in the media and communications industry allowed us to apply critical, relevant knowledge to HOYTS’ problem and create a solution that was not only fit for today, but also adaptable for HOYTS’ future,” shares Zoran Ojurovic, Executive Director, Client Services, NCS Australia.    A 5-year managed services contract has been signed. NCS Australia has shown we can align and support HOYTS’ core platform and has been appointed to provide HOYTS with a top-tier hosted managed service underpinned by Microsoft Azure, leveraging our strength as a trusted   Cloudflare is a cloud-based platform that provides content delivery network services, cloud cybersecurity and DDoS mitigation, and is also integral to the service offering. NCS Australia brings deep expertise driving digital transformation, with the Azure platform providing HOYTS with flexibility, scalability and the high performance they need. A shared service model is enabling us to work in lockstep. As needed, a team of specialists can be called upon to support project activities, helping drive efficiencies and enhanced outcomes for long-term success.  Several key requirements have been built into the platform service offering:    HOYTS and NCS Australia are transforming HOYTS’ core digital platform, demonstrating how modern architecture can go further than solving technical challenges and directly drive business growth. By coupling technical performance with business objectives, we are enabling technical excellence to translate to business success and enabling a more seamless digital ticketing experience for HOYTS’ customers. For HOYTS Cinemas, three out of every four transactions are now self-serve, either online or using digital kiosks in the foyers of its cinemas. NCS Australia is powering the process that ensures these transactions are handled correctly, supporting Australians having enjoyable movie experiences.  Share this article on: Acronis unifies data protection and cybersecurity, delivering cyber protection that solves

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  With the standard support of SAP ERP Central Component (ECC) systems ending in 2027, there is a need for existing SAP users to reoptimise their SAP core products for SAP HANA database. SAP users will have to migrate their existing SAP systems to one that meets the hardware requirements of running SAP S/4HANA. NCS can help enterprises migrate their existing SAP workloads to a Cloud platform as part of the SAP upgrading and rehosting support which provides efficiency, scalability, resiliency, agility and cost savings. AWS CloudEndure provides a simplified and automated lift and shift migration solution that can support SAP workloads such as SAP S/4HANA. This migration solution will greatly reduce the operational cost throughout the infrastructure migration process as it only requires temporary AWS staging servers. Once the SAP workloads are migrated to AWS infrastructure, the upgrade to S/4HANA will proceed to take place.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  The DevOps movement is about being able to deliver applications fast through automation, and having a shift left mentality where testing is performed earlier in the project lifecycle. As DevOps teams become more and more mature, concerns about testing, quality assurance and deployment are now being addressed earlier during the development process. But there remains one stumbling block which is preventing quick releases - security. To address this, the next logical step is to embed security into DevOps. From secure development perspective, there are different aspects that need to be covered. These include delivery practice, application security, infrastructure controls, and monitoring to ensure that compliance is maintained throughout the phases of development and operations. Below are some of the best practices that we would recommend for the design of a DevSecOps framework. Whether you are using the agile or waterfall development model, it is good to practise secure coding by regularly scanning your code and open source libraries, at least on a daily basis. You have to do both the   and   using tools that can detect the top security issues identified by the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP). Scanning should not stop at the code level. You should also scan for vulnerabilities while doing unit and functional tests using   A good tool should be able to follow the path of requests to any component of the application with full traceability to any vulnerabilities in the component. Finally, it is also a good practice to simulate attacks and try to penetrate your application from your front-end service using a  tool. Running all types of security testing in parallel with continuous integration lowers the risks of introducing vulnerabilities that could lead to security breaches. It is always a good idea to not allow any access to an application until the entity that is requesting access (device, user, system or application) is verified. Tighten verification by using token-based authentication, trusted certificates and multi-factor authentication. DevSecOps advocates the implementation of “security policy as code” which not only allows policies to be pushed out easily but also aids in monitoring compliance and maintaining (add, remove, update) policies. Using a configuration management tool to implement the “as code” approach will enable full automation and continuous compliance monitoring for environments including cloud, on-premises infrastructures and middleware.

                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  DevSecOps is supposed to introduce speed and efficiency into the application development cycle while ensuring security is embedded into every part of the process. For one government agency, the current DevSecOps pipeline designed was inefficient and not maintainable. The organisation wanted to make several changes in its applications and was relying on DevSecOps tools to get the job done quickly and efficiently. DevSecOps was expected to create a highly-collaborative environment between the developers and product owners, allowing the applications to be developed within two to three months using Agile Sprints. However, what it ended up with were processes that were difficult to manage, leading to high overheads. Due to limitations in the network environment, the continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) processes were isolated from each other, which went contrary to the principles and practices of DevOps design and created issues with pipeline management. Governance and traceability were also lacking, with little visibility into the version of codes that were being deployed into the production environment. NCS was invited to redesign the DevSecOps process and find ways to leverage the organisation’s existing investment in tools to bring application and release management teams together to participate in and review the software release process. After reviewing the state of DevSecOps in the organisation, NCS proposed setting up a collaborative environment where developers and users could work from multiple locations to reduce cost, while being able to exchange information seamlessly. It also proposed improvements to how DevSecOps tools could be used for the development of proof-of-concepts and applications. For example, the Jenkins CI/CD pipeline was redesigned using “Pipeline as Code” to improve maintainability, with the pipeline code maintained using the DevOps lifecycle tool GitLab to ensure proper version control. The “Multibranch Pipeline” approach was also applied to automatically discover, manage and execute pipelines for branches and provide instant feedback on the status of each source code branch. Shift left practices, where testing is performed earlier in the project lifecycle, were also recommended to ensure quality code and deliverables. Another step that NCS took was to re-evaluate plugins for the task management platform Jira and the collaboration software program Confluence, as well as the AWS EC2 instance types used by the DevOps tools to better manage operating costs. The collaborative platform proposed by NCS enabled the product owner and developer to work together and document the application development process more efficiently. This helped development teams to shorten project iterations and reduce the time taken from project approval to “go-live”, while ensuring that the end-product was acceptable to the customer. Governance was enhanced with continuous feedback and improved traceability for different revisions, versions and releases, and management overheads were reduced through the use of the CI/CD process to manage the incremental build of the product. At the same time, elimination of unnecessary plugins and instances helped reduce operating costs while the use of the AWS Relational Database Service enhanced the availability and reliability of the databases required for the DevOps tools including GitLab, SonarQube, Jira and Confluence.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  Employees are real asset to organisation. They are a great source of ideas for improving work processes, reducing administration complexity by introducing innovations to existing work processes. Recognising this, an organisation in Singapore wanted to find a way to evaluate staff ideas and convert the better ones into projects that will benefit the employees, administration and customers. It came up with the concept of a Digital factory that would speed up the process from ideation to realisation. However, it also recognised that its procurement processes were complex, with lengthy evaluation processes that meant it could take a long time to implement any staff suggestion. What the organisation needed was a way to test some of the employees’ ideas and fail them early if they did not look like they could deliver any benefits. The way to do this was through proofs of concepts (POCs) – simple projects developed within a span of 2-3 months to capture and evaluate the ideas and assess the potential benefits. These could be delivered either as services on the corporate Intranet or as mobile applications. Developing the POCs would require a highly collaborative environment where developers and project owners from different sites could exchange information and work together efficiently and cost-effectively. To address this, NCS recommended that the organisation use Amazon Web Services (AWS) to create the environment and tap on DevSecOps tools from AWS and other technology providers to develop the POCs. NCS worked with the organisation to set up a fully-collaborative environment where development teams and project owners can come together to document and develop a product that would be acceptable to end customer. The AWS platform allows multiple projects to be built at the same time, with common components that can be shared, reducing the development effort. The entire development is aided by continuous integration/continuous delivery process to manage the incremental build of the product. Shift left practices, which incorporate testing earlier in the development process, is applied to ensure the quality of code and deliverables. By using a cloud platform, development teams are also able to spin off managed Instances to support the applications as and when they are needed These shorten the development cycle, enabling projects to go-live so that good ideas can come to fruition more quickly to deliver benefits across the organisation.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  Many organisations today own IT applications that might be outdated, which results in inefficiencies and inefficacy in service delivery and outcome. To create new business value, organisations need to undergo application modernisation. As tempting as it is to retain legacy systems, the cost of doing so is often too high. Too many resources are required to update and maintain the legacy system. Even if these pain points can be tolerated, problems will snowball as newer operating systems are introduced into the system. People, culture, and systems often get in the way of change in digital transformation within organisation. Take the movement of IT assets from a host environment to a new one as an example. It is a sophisticated process which many organisations struggle to carry out. Deciding how to start the application modernisation process is a key challenge faced by most organisations. Taking a real-life example of bringing some IT assets from a host environment to a new one with limited time and a tight budget, it is important to keep the end-state or business goals in mind for each persona: citizen, implementation team and service owner. The key is to empathise with different stakeholders and understand the different priorities that each stakeholder has. Doing so will make the application modernisation process a lot easier to start. More often than not, organisations and stakeholders are too eager to roll out solutions, missing out on the ideation process. Being able to put yourself in the shoes of the end users before coming up with a solution is a key learning point. For project implementation, project management and compliance are key priorities. Equipping organisations with a team of people with the right skillsets remains important. So are tools and channels of communication between end users and organisations to derive the true performance of a given solution. As technology evolves, capturing real-time information to assess performance and user uptake become easier. Consequently, implementing government services will become more responsive, available, accurate and anticipatory in nature. Overall, citizen satisfaction will improve. Another point to note is that the line between service owner and implementation team are often blurred. So roles need to be clearly defined to build good partnerships and relationships within the teams. Choosing the right service provider, in terms of cost, quality and value, are also instrumental in the overarching concern of protecting the government’s image. In terms of operational risks and factors of implementing applications, an interesting idea was brought up in relation to the public sector, application modernisation should focus more on value especially among the higher echelons of government. Coined as “Value of Government”, the political leadership should be operationally driven. Acting as a new source of motivation, governments should rethink how they can deliver exceptional value and how to respond, anticipate and especially delight its citizens. Microservices and lo-code services - the former was a hot choice among attendees given the granularity it affords, is quick and the most agile to implement. Nevertheless, context, nature, usage and consistency were factors to consider before implementing microservices as a tool. Ultimately, application modernisation is a gradual process. The key is whether there is an orchestration mechanism, be it in the implementation team or through the service owner, to meld all considerations; systems, people and work culture, and present a cohesive strategy to stakeholders for delivery. At the end of the day, every organisation’s battle hymn will be different. Despite the chaos, every transformation has a flow. The real challenge in modernising legacy applications is knowing your organisation’s needs and capabilities. Organisations and Governments will continue to transform to find a sweet spot between customer satisfaction and harnessing the power of IT solutions.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  The desired state for organisations is to have the ability to do continuous delivery with speed and application stability. This has led them to adopting DevOps – a set of practices that integrate development and operations to promote collaboration between previously isolated teams. DevOps incorporates a continuous feedback mechanism that allows ongoing improvement aided by automation. Security has also been included into the framework, leading to the term DevSecOps which encompasses speed, quality and security in application development To ensure that environments can be easily managed and automated, we advocate approaching DevOps with as-a-code mindset, which focuses on continuous integration and infrastructure management. This makes all components more maintainable and facilitates a means to govern the deployment of infrastructure. In the case of continuous integration/continuous development (CI/CD) for example, the “as code” mindset helps to ensure that development pipelines can be easily defined, tracked and changed. For instance, with Jenkins pipeline implementations using Jenkinsfile, approval mechanisms can be set in place and managed by the development teams as they would for any other code. This helps with change control and audit. Change history can be traced and when configurations go wrong, developers would have a way to rollback easily to previous configurations, without the need to keep backing up the entire Jenkins job configuration. With infrastructure as code, teams will be able to replace entire environments with the assurance that all configurations would be consistent. For example, in cloud-based environments, scripts can be used to define everything from virtual machines to firewall rules and network layout, and provide the assurance that each component will have the same configuration every time the script runs. Approaching DevSecOps with an “as code” mindset ensures that application development environments can be easily managed and automated. It makes all components more maintainable and provides a way for entire infrastructure models to be governed. The “as code” approach can also be applied to the setup of workstations. System and software engineers developing applications and maintaining infrastructures face an ongoing challenge in setting up complex workstations to help them do their job. A new member who just joined the development team is usually given documentation with instructions on how he can set up his machine. This often involves installing different toolsets, integrated development environments (IDEs) and setting up environment variables – tasks that will probably require assistance from his colleagues and take a full day to complete. The same laborious tasks confront existing team members who get a laptop replacement, or a trainer who needs to set up environments for application training. These are just some of the use cases for automating the setup of workstations using the “as code” approach. Scripting your Windows environment, for example, will deliver benefits such as: Developers may make mistakes by downloading software and installing it without verifying the authenticity of the download and the site that they are downloading it from. The “as code” approach eliminates this risk by ensuring that you always get the correct, legitimate software by configuring the setup to download from a trusted repository. Speed of deployment and setup is improved by automating the retrieval of executables from the trusted repository Version updates can be easily managed and distributed across the entire organisation. Setup is less likely to fail because the version and configuration of the software is controlled by the script. The “as code” approach thus reduces the effort needed to set up environments and workstations, enabling teams to achieve better time-to-value, and to deliver greater flexibility and agility to the organisation.

Adopting a mobile centric approach to digital transformation | NCS AU adopting a mobile centric approach to digital transformation Contact Us Thank you for your interest. What does “mobile-centric” really mean? Positive disruption to public services Breaking down silos Transforming ecosystems How to get started explore more 
                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  Six out of seven billion people on this planet have mobile phones and they are using it not only to communicate but also to transact. According to a  , more than 62 per cent of those with smartphones have made a purchase using their mobile devices in the past six months. As your organisation embarks on digital transformation, this is an important factor to keep in mind. Increasingly, your customers, business partners and employees will be interacting and transacting with you on their mobile devices such as smart phones and tablets. So as you re-think your business models and redesign your processes for digital transformation, it is wise to put mobile centricity front and centre of your considerations. Mobile centricity simply means delivering an omni-channel experience that leverages mobile capabilities and technologies to enhance the entire user experience and not just the smart phone experience. This allows users to access online contents and transact seamlessly using their hand-held mobile devices or kiosks. With a mobile centric approach, you are making use of mobile devices as your main platform to drive digital transformation. The user experience that you create on mobile devices must be just as effective, if not more so, than any other user touchpoint. But it is also important to think about mobile devices and platforms not just as another customer channel but also as an all-encompassing strategy for breaking down silos, leveraging next-generation technologies and innovating for the future. This mindset has helped to revolutionise business and operating models for some private sector enterprises (think Netflix and mobile banking) and also transformed the way public agencies engage with the community and deliver services to citizens. In Singapore, agencies like the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF), Singapore Police Force and Land Transport Authority (just to name a few) have adopted mobile-centric strategies to inform, engage and empower citizens and customers. The SGSecure app launched by the Ministry of Home Affairs allows the Police and the SCDF to alert users to major emergencies such as terrorist attacks and public order incidents. It also allows users to inform the agencies of major incidents via text, photos or videos using mobile devices, empowering them to play a critical role in homeland security. Another app by SCDF, myResponder, notifies members of the public – also known as Community First Responders – to nearby cardiac arrest and minor fire cases, as well as the location of the nearest AEDs. This helps save lives by bringing together the community and agency to render assistance. To better serve the needs of commuters and road users beyond providing information through the LTA website, LTA’s app MyTransport.SG provides user-centric features such as a multi-modal journey planner, alerts and a host of other functions to deliver personalised travel experiences to bus and MRT users, motorists, cyclists and pedestrians. It is important to note that the pivotal aspect of a mobile-centric strategy is not just about rolling out applications via mobile platforms; it is about breaking down silos in the back end so that the data and applications can come together to deliver user-centric services. Take LTA’s MyTransport.SG app for example. It is powered by LTA Data Mall, a platform that brings together a wide variety of land transport-related datasets for stakeholders (enterprises, third-party developers, researchers, and other members of the public) to co-create innovative and inclusive transport solutions. The information that MyTransport.SG provides to its users (such as road conditions, bus arrival times etc) is taken from the LTA Data Mall. If mobile technology is viewed as the car driving digital transformation, data is the fuel that is powering it. It is the combination of mobile technology and data that sets the stage for a mobile-centric digital transformation. This can be a very powerful catalyst for change. Beyond impacting individual organisations, the combination can also serve as a platform for transforming entire ecosystems. The transport sector is a case in point. The combination of mobile technology and data paves the way for a disruptive transformation of the transport ecosystem that shifts the operating paradigm away from personally-owned modes of transportation towards the provision of Mobility-as-a-Service (referring to transportation). This is enabled by combining transportation services from public and private transportation providers through a unified gateway that creates and manages each trip, which users can pay for with a single account. So a commuter could potentially use an application on his mobile device to plan his end-to-end journey by taking the MRT, then picking up a bicycle at the MRT station to ride to his destination. Such are the possibilities and opportunities that open up with a mobile-centric business strategy. But where does your organisation begin on this journey? Here are a few principles to help jump-start the process: With these considerations in mind, start developing a proper strategy and plan for your organisation to embark on a mobile-first digital transformation. You need to make sure that you are making the right investments in mobile technologies to power your business into the future.

                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  In the business world and the natural world alike, survival and success are all about adapting to change. As new technologies emerge to disrupt existing business models, organisations need to digitally evolve according to consumer habits, technology innovations and external environmental factors. Organisations know this and have made digital transformation a top priority. In fact, a 2018 survey by   found that 89 percent of the organisations surveyed have plans to adopt a digital-first business strategy. However, the same analysis also showed that only 45 percent of the organisations surveyed have yet to fully adopt this approach. Many felt that they lacked the skills to execute digital transformation strategies—such as embracing a digital culture or identifying technologies best-suited for them. Clearly, digital transformation is easier said than done. According to  , 84 percent of organisations that attempt to undergo digital transformation fail. What can companies do to increase their chance of success? Just as the DNA of living organisms determines their characteristics and ability to adapt to environmental stresses, digital DNA refers to the combination of the different organisational, human and technological factors that make up the digital component of an organisation. Like the technology itself, an organisation’s digital DNA also needs to evolve to cater to consumer habits. The first key component of digital DNA is customer experience. Understanding customer expectations or consumer habits are crucial as the new generation is very digitally active. Everything is done through their mobile phones, 24/7. That’s another technological disruption that every enterprise—small, medium or large—needs to face. As consumer habits evolve, organisations need to experiment and adopt new technologies quickly. Here, the next key component, being cloud-native, is instrumental, allowing organisations to scale-up rapidly and flexibly. The move to be cloud-native will be cost-effective, and will provide agility when the applications are being developed. The third component of digital DNA is application modernisation, referring to the replacement, re-tooling or re-platforming of legacy applications. This in turn goes hand-in-hand with the fourth and final technical component of digital DNA: building platforms that can support entire ecosystems instead of individual products. While connectivity within an organisation is very important, building an ecosystem outside your organisation is even more crucial. A flexible and robust API-centric approach enables develop successful platforms. Technical considerations aside, the most important aspect of digital transformation is the adoption of digital culture, the fifth component of digital DNA. Digital transformation requires breaking down deeply entrenched silos and maintaining momentum over the entire process, which can take three to five years. One of the biggest challenges of digital transformation is the difficulty of bringing the whole organisation on board as part of the transformation. More positively, there are three aspects of adopting a digital culture that firms should encourage: data-driven decision-making, human-centric design thinking and an agile mindset. Data-driven decision-making eliminates any guesswork within an organisation, while human-centric design thinking will encourage organisations to approach problems with the end-user in mind. Combined with an agile delivery, these approaches require a new mindset and even a change in organisational structure. Organisations might experience failure in their digital transformation journey. It is extremely important for organisations to go through experiential stages and learn to take failure as part of their learning culture. Obviously, nobody will get it right the first time, employees have to go through iterations of learning. As the market leader in Singapore, NCS is well-placed to help your organisation navigate the next wave of technological disruption. In the course of its own digital transformation journey, NCS has trained over 3,000 employees, equipping them with design thinking, agile leadership and user experience/user interface (UX/UI) skills. Along the way, NCS successfully automated more than 15 processes with five robots implemented across different corporate functions over a six-month period. Technology such as facial recognition access, smart facilities, physical security and incident management were integrated into NCS’ physical premises, and an app was developed for employees. Our journey began three years ago and is still ongoing, demonstrating that digital transformation is a sprint marathon, requiring speed, focus and execution. Just as DNA determines the strength and weaknesses of a living organism, a digital DNA helps to determine the success of an organisation’s digital transformation.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  Riley worked with one of Australia’s largest cinema operators that plays movies for its patrons on 704 screens across 74 sites in all Australian states and territories. Riley provided a cost and time-efficient solution to a long-winded, automated customer service recording. In our recent case study, we explore how Riley streamlined the customer experience by utilising AWS' Cognitive CX suite.   The Cinema runs a ‘1300 MOVIE’ business phone service for movie session times. Previously, when users dialled the phone service for session times, they were presented with a recorded message. Customers were then required to wait for their cinema of interest to be announced, before making a two-digit selection in their keypads to communicate with the existing bot. This degraded the user experience; customers listened as tens of cinemas were read out by the bot. On their end, the cinema staff were required to generate recordings for each session time manually at all 74 cinemas each day. Updating the recording was a costly and time-consuming task. In succession to Riley's chatbot solution was a drastic 30 hour (per week) reduction of laborious manual data entry for staff, in addition to streamlining the customer experience from upwards of 10 minutes down to 30 seconds. When the phone service is dialled, customers are now prompted to state their required cinema directly to the chatbot. The system then sources and responds with real-time information from the cinema’s website API. It further assists the customer by now indicating sold-out session times. The cinema was able to reduce the costs of running the service, receiving an immediate positive ROI, whilst simultaneously improving customer satisfaction.

Google Cloud Results Fostering a bootstrapped startup's growth with intuitive cloud architecture and proactive support Reaching premium advertisers around the globe with a world-class content delivery network Seamless serverless architecture to enable nimble and flexible growth Unlimited data analytics power to provide instant readouts of buyer-seller requirements A future of global growth building powerful advertising CRM with machine learning tools 
                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:   deep understanding of Google Cloud enabled Publift to deliver a 55% boost in client ad revenue, increases customer base by 150% in one year, and saves 30% in manpower hours per week using CloudCDN, CloudFunctions, BigQuery and DataStudio. 
  - Frees up developers time to grow business offering by saving 30% of manpower hours per week 
- Enables global reach through millisecond-level latency in content delivery network 
- Promotes cost-effective operations through intuitive infrastructure that eliminates the need for a dedicated DevOps team 
- Enables innovation for global growth with ML toolkit to power customer performance analysis 
- Delivers scalability to absorb 150% client base surge The internet today is a sea of   and counting. At the same time, former Google advertising executives Colm Dolan and Tobin Page had a front-row seat on the struggles of online publishers (websites and bloggers) to attract quality advertising to monetize their content. The experience led the friends to launch  , an ad-tech startup that applies the new field of   to empower digital publishers to optimize revenue while focusing on content creation. Programmatic advertising levels the online advertising playing field by creating an automated marketplace for advertisers to bid on website ad space, instead of seeking agency-mediated deals. By opening the market to greater competition, programmatic advertising enables publishers to secure higher rates and better ads. 
  Colm and Tobin aimed to offer unique value through its proprietary platform called Fuse that maximizes the number of advertisers competing for ad space, thus optimizing the publisher's revenue potential. To succeed, Publift needed unlimited scalability and global reach, to keep pace with demand spikes and connect buyers and sellers anywhere in the world. It also needed world-class data analytics to crunch the vast amounts of bidding data coursing through the system. Publift turned to   and discovered the ideal toolkit to open a new chapter in online publishing. "Our vision is to bring unique value to programmatic advertising with cloud-based innovation and scaling power that gives publishers access to hard-to-reach advertisers,"said the Head of Technology, Publift." We were able to create a user-friendly engine to crack open the online advertising marketplace with a combination of  ,  ,   and  ." 
  Colm and Tobin set out five years ago to disrupt digital advertising with a small team of developers that had little expertise in managing cloud infrastructure. They were also a bootstrapped startup that relied on platform revenue for growth rather than venture capital. On both fronts, says Joe, Google Cloud provided key support to get Publift's journey off the ground. The team began life on a rival cloud provider and soon found it was spending more time on infrastructure tasks, and more credits on cloud services, than it could afford. The picture changed when Publift won an introduction to the   program, which empowers qualified startups with mentorship, training and cloud credits, and decided to give it a try. Unlike the original provider, the Google Cloud program fostered Publift's venture by supplying credits as long as they were used up within a finite period of time. On the operational side, the team found Google Cloud's infrastructure services to be more intuitive, with automated features that required no additional work from the team. "The startup program liberated us from the anxiety of how much we were spending on developing the platform, enabling us to innovate and build more into our platform," recalls Joe. "Likewise, the intuitive interface and automation on Google Cloud freed our team to do what it does best, which is to create code." Joe estimates that the simple switch to a more user-friendly Google Cloud infrastructure saved the team up to 30% manpower hours per week on maintenance tasks. Three years on, Publift is running an award-winning platform that enables its clients to enjoy 55% average revenue growth after six months of using the Fuse platform. Throughout this journey of success, Publift didn't need to invest in a separate DevOps team to support the infrastructure. With partner Riley, which provides guidance on backend optimization in monthly catch-ups, Publift got to enjoy a priceless cost advantage. For example, Riley recently provided Publift with advice on tweaking   settings to bring down data warehouse spend, and those savings are expected to roll in within upcoming months. "We get together with Riley on a monthly basis to go through our system and talk through pain points, optimization, and cost control," says Joe. "Along with the user-friendly architecture of Google Cloud, Riley is another reason we don't need to build any dedicated infrastructure team." 
  Publift's success depends on reliable delivery of its vast repository of JavaScript files anywhere in the world, with millisecond-level latency. That means a robust content delivery network is critical to ensure that real-time bidding proceeds without glitches that could break a deal. Publift chose Cloud CDN after testing it against five rival offerings. Google Cloud came out on top both for speed and reliability, due to Google's global network of data centers. "Without a massive, consistent content delivery network, we wouldn't be able to deliver our business at all," says Joe. "On Cloud CDN, our solution can instantly access the global advertising marketplace and deliver our code with minimum latency on planetary scale." 
  Since beginning its Google Cloud journey on virtual machines (VMs), Publift has switched to an entirely serverless architecture that lives on Cloud Functions and  . These two solutions enable Publift to deploy highly scalable applications affordably and flexibly. "If some business requirement changes, we can quickly run new code on Cloud Functions, or modify existing services on Cloud Run, without having to dig through deep layers of code or complex dependencies," says Joe. These two solutions allow Publift to rapidly respond to sudden changes in commercial requirements. Real-time scaling enabled by Google Cloud's serverless infrastructure has also enabled Publift to absorb a more than 150% surge in client base, from about 100 to over 250 in the past year. 
  Data analytics are a critical part of the Fuse solution, integrating data points of marketplace players to automatically find the best matches. Publift deploys BigQuery as its core data analytics solution because of its ability to process datasets of unlimited size and provide instant data-driven readouts of buyer-seller needs. It can then plug Data Studio directly into BigQuery to obtain easy-to-read dashboarding of business performance, both for Publift's team and its clients. "BigQuery makes life a lot easier for us," says Joe. "It not only allows us to work with massive amounts of data. It's also so intuitive to use that we can continue working with a bare-bones team without having to build a dedicated data engineering team." 
  The onset of COVID-19 hit the online advertising industry hard. It also served as a catalyst for industry players to leverage the automated matchmaking offered by programmatic advertising, as a means to weather the storm. Publift soon found its services in greater demand, as publishers sought more efficient ways to earn ad revenue. That has led it to accelerate plans for expansion beyond Australia and New Zealand, into Asia and eventually the US and Europe. To support global growth, Publift is planning an overhaul of its cloud infrastructure to enable unlimited, low-latency scalability at planetary level. That means adopting   to manage infrastructure and   to optimize seamless autoscaling in content delivery, integrated with Cloud CDN. , meanwhile, will bring Publift a fully managed, scalable database that can provide latency below 10 milliseconds on millions of requests per second. Alongside fostering new markets, Publift plans to enhance its value by developing a powerful data analytics solution to optimize client performance. The tool will provide intuitive, data-driven analysis of revenue fluctuations, deploying Google Cloud machine learning solutions such as  . "The next chapter of our journey will be developing innovations that bring us more insight into how we can best optimize client revenue," says Joe. "So we're excited to be in a Google Cloud environment that puts cutting-edge AI tools at our fingertips to build these solutions for our customers." Share this article on: Thank you for your enquiry!

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  With a commitment to providing trusted news for Australians, Australian Associated Press (AAP) has chosen to partner with NCS Australia on its digital transformation journey. By helping AAP modernise, NCS is providing a foundation for the publisher to apply powerful data analysis and aggregation, unlocking new possibilities with AI and machine learning as it evolves its approach to delivering quality, public interest journalism for Australians. NCS has led AAP’s successful migration from a VMWare environment to Google Cloud, delivering:   Watch this video to hear more about AAP’s digital transformation, and discover additional videos where technical leaders discuss the details about AAP’s modernisation journey.   NCS Australia is a strategic and trusted technology partner for Google Cloud. Leaders involved in this modernisation project from NCS, AAP and   give their insights on the work, impact and outcomes achieved. Insights and reflections - setting AAP up for success Insights and reflections - technology to enable tomorrow for AAP As an independent publisher, AAP had been relying on older operating systems in a complex IT environment, and managing vast volumes of data. AAP sought to simplify and unify its mixed digital environments, reaching out to NCS to see what was possible. The publisher wanted to reduce its risk profile by better safeguarding sensitive information and improving how it manages and governs data efficiently. AAP’s outdated operating systems and complex and diverse IT environment included a maze of multiple cloud service providers in addition to holding vast volumes of data including an extensive photo archive over 45 terabytes in size. The system’s complexity meant high-running costs and a heavy reliance on data centres. Additionally, the use of outdated Microsoft licensing systems made the migration from Windows-based applications to Google Cloud challenging, threatening the stability of the operating environment – both during business as usual but in particular, during the transition. Data security was also a project priority for AAP for the business to achieve its long-term goals, with the security of sensitive information and its digital infrastructure critical to the success of the project and AAP’s data governance protocols. 
  NCS Australia was engaged to support AAP in undergoing a significant digital transformation, with the aim of modernising its systems. Our team planned and implemented a multi-phased migration successfully from on-premise VMware, Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Oracle Cloud to Google Cloud, transforming AAP’s infrastructure that underpins how it operates. The project involved multiple workstreams from fact-checking to photo licensing and newswire distribution. It was essential project management and delivery was completed with minimal downtime and disruption, positioning AAP well for future tech-led growth and innovation. 
  To plan and prepare for AAP’s migration from a VMWare environment to Google Cloud, NCS conducted a series of discovery workshops using Google’s migration assessment tooling, assessing application dependencies, security requirements and migration options. Designing a target architecture, leveraging Google Cloud’s managed services – including Cloud Storage, Cloud SQL, VMWare Engine, Compute Engine and Cloud Run - NCS was able to reduce the complexity of AAP’s tech environment, achieving improved scalability and operational viability for existing and future needs. Key examples included the architecture of a more cost-effective storage solution for AAP’s extensive 45 terabyte photo archive. The migration was implemented via a phased migration plan to minimise disruption and downtime, prioritising critical applications and ensuring a quick and seamless transition to a Google Cloud VMWare Engine (GCVE), with zero downtime. A second phase focused on modernisation, seeing workloads from AWS reformatted and moved into Google Cloud native services with solutions including Serverless, Managed Databases, Object-based Storage. This phase helped NCS improve the resiliency and security of AAP’s tech environment, negating the need for VPNs, and achieving operational efficiencies both in terms of cost and process improvement.   This IT modernisation project has enabled AAP to continue to evolve, which is vital to its continued success in Australia’s modern publishing industry. With fresh efficiencies in how it operates, AAP can now better balance the competing pressures of having finite resource constraints with expectations from consumers. This includes improving the quality of data that informs how it fact checks information already circulating online through AAP FactCheck – a leading third-party fact checking tool it offers – plus capacity to produce high quality journalism at scale. AAP has also significantly reduced its overall IT spend and enhanced its security posture. Partnering with NCS and Google Cloud has unlocked a significant step forward for AAP, as it looks to retain its agility and evolve, powered by next-generation technology as it continues thriving as a trusted source of news. The migration from a VMWare environment to Google Cloud and unification of its cloud service has helped AAP achieve greater scalability, flexibility and agility to meet future demands too. With deep expertise in innovation, artificial intelligence and digital resilience, NCS is also setting AAP up today for the day after tomorrow. AI and machine learning offer AAP opportunities to further enhance its operations, as well as provide a better experience for consumers – upholding its standards of public interest journalism while adapting to tomorrow’s media landscape.

"Effective use of threat intelligence requires a new, integrated security model that will be able to address cyber challenges in this era of digital transformation." explore more 
                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  Digital transformation elevates the challenges for cybersecurity as attack surfaces expand with increased connectivity and growing volumes of data flowing in and out of enterprise networks. And to a certain extent, how well organisations manage these challenges and operationalise threat intelligence can be mirrored in where they stand on the IDC Digital Transformation (DX) MaturityScape¹. In a Singtel-commissioned whitepaper on “Digital Transformation in the Intelligence Economy”, IDC describes, at the one end, “digitally distraught” organisations with DX initiatives that are tactical and disconnected from a larger enterprise strategy. At the other end of the MaturityScape, we see “digitally determined” organisations with DX initiatives are integrated, continuous, and have a transformative impact across the organisation. In the cybersecurity space, the “digitally determined” are those who are able to make use of threat intelligence in an integrated and continuous fashion to improve risk management efficiency and effectiveness, automate remediation tasks, and establish a central threat management service for the organisation. However, despite a big push in recent years to set up security operations centres, acquire new threat detection technologies and make better use of threat intelligence, many are still “distraught”. And the main reason is that they are attempting to operationalise threat intelligence across a multitude of point tools and manual processes. This becomes a problem as the number of data sources continues to grow, together with the sheer volume and increased sophistication of threats that organisations encounter on a day-to-day basis. Without the ability to integrate and consolidate threat data and to automate analysis, organisations will soon reach “alert fatigue”. So, what are the key steps to take – and factors to consider – when developing an operational model that will enable organisations to make effective use of threat intelligence? As with DX, the first thing to do is to get executive sponsorship and establish an open dialogue between IT - in this case, cybersecurity - and business leaders within the organisation. Leaders who define common goals and measure progress with metrics are able to determine acceptable levels of risk that translate into the most efficient deployment of a company’s limited IT resources. They will be able to drive policy-making decisions and ensure that these policies are translated into strong change management processes, disciplined access control mechanisms, and automated authorisation and verification rules. When building an operational model for security, the business-security dialogue will help ensure that there is executive backing for the integration effort that is needed before organisations can optimise their use of threat intelligence. The effective use of threat intelligence will require organisations to have centralised oversight of intelligence programmes and feeds, and visibility into who is using the intelligence and for what purpose. This means integrating all the threat intelligence onto one platform to help the organisation to identify redundancies and inefficiencies, and rationalise what is being used, by who, and how. The operational model will also have to ensure that threat intelligence is delivered at the right time to the right audience. As ESG pointed out in a research report², “threat intelligence is only good when it’s relevant, and it’s only relevant when it comes at the right time and provides proper context.” Good threat intelligence should also simplify decisions on how organisations should respond to threats. And this requires the use of analytics to process threat data into usable information. A good analytics tool with smart customisation options will be able to identify patterns and zoom in on bona fide threats instead of raising an alert at every flagged keyword. It will enable data to be sorted, filtered and combined to get a more accurate picture of the threats facing the organisation. ESG cited the example of a piece of binary data like an IP address taken from a threat feed, which might be combined with more information about a rogue domain, a recent sighting of that IP by a honeypot, and a tweet that suggests an attack might have come from it. “A solution that is able to see the link between these disparate threads will provide far more context, allowing users to make more informed decisions,” it said. Operationalising threat intelligence, therefore, requires organisations to have centralised oversight of the multitude of data feeds, and strong analytics capabilities to ensure that the intelligence is translated into insights that are timely, relevant and easily actionable. This will make the difference between the “determined” and the “distraught”. Share this article on: Discover how you can chart your career and elevate your skills.

                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  COVID-19 has driven the world’s biggest shift to remote working to date. And it’s time to acknowledge that moving forward, working from home will be one of the new norm. Many Singaporean employers were caught off guard when the official Circuit Breaker measures were first announced. There was little time for a gradual transition and companies had to somehow support a fully remote workforce within a few days. Supporting a fully remote workforce - on this scale - is new to many companies. So, what do some businesses have that others lack when it comes to implementing remote work arrangements? We’ve heard of many success stories like Google or Facebook, which recently announced that their employees will be allowed to work from home for the rest of the year. It seems simple for these companies to carry out such measures, but why? In the last month alone, NCS has empowered thousands of employees to transition from a mostly office-bound environment to a decentralised work from home environment. Here are some learnings and best practices in preparing for this new normal of working from home. The key considerations for enabling work-from-home (WFH) for your business revolves around the capacity of the business for a distributed work operations. A useful way to look at this is to ask: The extent to which you can adopt a WFH model depends on how far you can advance in each of these areas. If your processes are still heavily paper dependent, then it could be beneficial to quickly see how you can digitise them at the edge and at the core. An organisation running on digitalised processes is inherently better able to function in a WFH model. Similarly, if your workforce is already conversant with collaboration tools, they will be better equipped to WFH. And underpinning all this, is to have a robust cybersecurity plan to manage the risks that arise in a WFH landscape. As an organisation, we had the benefit of a highly digital-savvy team who is familiar with working remotely. We also had the benefit of having many of our operations already digitalised. Hence our primary challenge in rapidly enabling a full WFH environment was infrastructural in nature. The challenge of rapidly scaling up our networks and VPNs to enable WFH for our sizable workforce of more than 9,000 employees. Being the leading ICT service provider in Singapore and supporting essential service providers in the public sector, this was a critical challenge we had to step up to, in order to ensure business continuity for ourselves and our clients. Our team of infrastructure engineers and technical management talents rallied to the cause, and we rapidly scaled up our connectivity infrastructure: 1. Our VPN capabilities were boosted 2. We reshaped our internal networks Our current approach has proven successful in enabling thousands of NCS employees with the resources and ability to work from home effectively and safely.

                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  A globalising, interconnected world is elevating industrial IT and Operational Technology (OT) security to the forefront of today’s boardroom agenda. Specifically, the hardware and software used in the production area on factory floors, utility plants and electrical grids, water supplies, and in many engineering and research and development facilities. Several high profile security breaches in power plants and other critical infrastructure have served to escalate OT security concerns in recent months. This is especially important, because the digital transformation of industry will cause more convergence between IT and OT systems. Connectivity between the systems will increase to facilitate more efficient business processes, and this increases the attack surface and the vectors available to reach OT systems. But what are the real threats facing user companies and what should they prioritise for cyber defences? What unique concerns and challenges (external and internal factors) are impacting industrial cybersecurity? What strategies and measures are available to secure these vital assets? There are clear headwinds approaching OT security that senior management should be aware of. Escalating cyber threats in the industrial sectors and changes in legislation have heightened the profile of OT security recently. For example, the power supply disruptions in Ukraine in 2015 and 2016 triggered by cyber attacks on the country’s electricity distribution and transmission systems sent shockwaves across the globe. The incidents and others like them have reinforced how cyber attacks in the OT and Industrial Control Systems (ICS) space can severely impact organisations, even the physical functioning of society. Ransomware attacks such as Petya and NotPetya have also shut down manufacturing lines and affected banking, government and airport operations. More recently, the analysis of malware targeted at OT systems such as Industroyer and Triton has increased awareness of cyber threats to industrial control systems. We now have a better understanding of the impact such threats can unleash, including physical infrastructure.” Another major driver behind the renewed focus on OT security is the changing legislative landscape. The introduction of the Cybersecurity Bill and its associated Code of Practice in Singapore, for example, has influenced the rising focus on OT Security in Singapore. These legislative changes mandate that all ICS must be assessed, tested and monitored consistently. Prioritising security as a matter of policy drives organisations to relook the security practices they have in place. While OT and ICS security are receiving much needed attention, many affected organisations face significant hurdles. One of these is visibility over the assets that run the OT systems and visibility over the security of those assets. Without visibility, organisations struggle to identify the security posture of their system. In the area of ICS, many organisations are struggling with managing legacy software, proprietary systems and distributed ownership as they seek to deploy security solutions that may not be compatible with older systems. Organisations must recognise that attack surfaces in ICS are different. It’s critical to identify cybersecurity products and vendors that understand the context of this space, and offer solutions that can work with and not against these systems. Organisations can improve the protection of their OT systems by ensuring that any systems upgrade or new systems built adhere to a security-by-design process. That means that all hardware and software as well as protocols and workflows are designed to be secure. This requires incorporating OT priorities in cybersecurity practices: OT and ICS security practitioners must accept that malicious practices are inevitable. Organisations are better off being prepared with strong understanding of the risks, putting risk mitigations in place, ensuring visibility through monitoring, and maintaining a trained workforce with robust incident handling processes. 1) Risk assessment Start with a risk assessment of the resident risks in the OT and ICS. Taking stock of OT system assets is an important first step to instituting better protection and monitoring practices. Plan and implement mitigation measures with an understanding that OT systems are built to last and are designed with different priorities, often with physical safety and availability being paramount and highly prioritised. For example, many OT systems were designed at a time when OT systems were not accessible remotely. The security measures put in place may not consider for new remote access connectivity. Finally, expand security policies, such as implementing post-breach procedures that are appropriate and sensible in an OT/ICS environment. 2) Visibility With ICS and OT environments consisting of many types of equipment, often with Industrial Internet of Things co-existing with legacy Industrial Control Systems, getting a centralised view is difficult. The greater scope of asset types and legacy equipment presents challenges that traditional IT environments do not encounter. OT networks are getting increasingly connected and complex. The greater attack surface elevates the importance of monitoring and at the same time, making monitoring itself even more challenging. While security tools for IT and OT vary, monitoring and threat detection should be simplified as much as possible through smart aggregator platforms that provide useful information in ‘a single pane of glass’, Better visibility and continuous monitoring of systems to identify breaches quickly and start incident investigations should be mandatory for organisations with OT and ICS environments. 3) Upgrading skills Organisations should also invest in upskilling teams to ensure cybersecurity practices are relevant and up to date. Cybersecurity knowledge and skillsets can no longer be confined to only the IT teams. Non-IT personnel, including OT engineering and production teams, need to be included in cybersecurity processes, such as incident reporting, handling and management. They are essential to ensuring a more cyber secure organisation. Organisations can look for security partners that have experience in OT and ICS, to ensure that cybersecurity best practices are upheld. These can include scenario-based OT security training courses involving offensive and defensive operations that integrate real and simulated exercises. Such training can be customised to cover water, power, transportation, and manufacturing for more realistic visualisation and adoption, to counter OT and ICS cyber-attacks effectively. 4) Security Partnerships In all of these, organisations can turn to security partners that have experience in securing OT and ICS. Ensuring the security and resilience of OT and ICS is a shared responsibility among multiple stakeholders, internally and externally, because no one person or entity has the knowledge, authority or resources to do it alone. For many ICS environments, it’s not a matter of if an attack will take place, but when. In 20171, the Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT) identified 753 vulnerabilities through its 137 architecture design reviews, and many more went unreported or undetected. Attacks on ICS installations are increasing in frequency and complexity; building a network with a hardened perimeter is no longer adequate. Securing ICSs against modern threats requires well-planned and well-implemented strategies to quickly and effectively detect, counter, and expel attackers. At Trustwave, we offer a variety of services to secure OT and ICS through our consultancy services, including risks and vulnerability assessments, and penetration testing, to assess the security posture of the organisation. Trustwave’s advisory consulting team helps organisations transform and mature their security operations, offering managed threat detection (MTD) that covers both IT and ICS security monitoring. Our managed threat detection service covers use cases and analytics that are focused on identifying cyber security incidents in ICS environments. Last but not least, Trustwave conducts classes on OT security to assist OT engineers in improving their cybersecurity awareness.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  A cybersecurity strategy is similar to our biological immune systems. Threats grow in complexity even when our defences respond to contain them. A healthy cybersecurity ecosystem is vital to ensuring that your business stays protected from attacks. It’s hard to ignore the similarities between cybersecurity systems and our own biological immune systems. Just like our bodies, threats grow in complexity even as the anatomy’s defences respond to contain them. With each attack, the immune system learns to improve its responses or is overwhelmed and succumbs to the attack. In both cases, keeping the component parts of the immune system’s defences in check is the key to ensuring a robust response and repelling attacks. A cybersecurity ecosystem comprises a diverse array of parts – computers, software, communications technologies, cyber devices and appliances, compliance and regulatory bodies/frameworks, processes, and people – that interact for multiple purposes. A healthy cybersecurity ecosystem will ensure all components are working together in near real-time to anticipate and prevent cyber attacks, limit the attack spread, mitigate the consequences, and restore systems and networks to a trusted state. Security capabilities are built into the cybersecurity infrastructure in a way that allows preventive and defensive courses of action to be coordinated within the corporate network with trusted information exchanges and shared, configurable policies. A healthy cyber ecosystem operates via layered defences and countermeasures that work in tandem, much like antibodies responding to a virus in our body. This ecosystem works from within the body (the corporate network), covering all vital functions (the whole enterprise), learns, adapts and remembers (identify and monitor threats, analyse and remediate, watch and prevent), and responds quickly (intervention). Setting out a blueprint for a healthy cybersecurity immune system requires a deeper understanding of the organisation’s security posture and how it maps against the business goals. Only then, can the enterprises assess if there are gaps in defences, and have a clearer picture of their security readiness. Here are six steps to include: Good hygiene precedes a strong and healthy cybersecurity immune system. This is a quality check on the individual components of the ecosystem to ensure they are fully functioning so the whole defence infrastructure doesn’t break down when attacked. This calls for regular security audits, investments in improving current defences, processes and protocols, and continuous training to keep security practitioners current at all times. For example, strengthen incident response by deploying a blue team environment that looks at ways to defend, change, and re-group security mechanisms. Other steps include network segmentation, perimeter protection, privilege and authentication controls, and asset isolation. Pervasive visibility is to a cybersecurity immune system what blood is to the human circulatory system. Without persistent visibility across both the physical and virtual (including hybrid clouds) networks, detection, prediction, and response will be weak at best. Establishing visibility into all systems at the network-packet and metadata level via a single pane of glass will allow security defences to contain the threat effectively. Much like how a virus spreads across organs in the human circulatory system, malware often targets lateral movement between vital computing systems and devices in the corporate network. Faced with good cyber hygiene, the malware will attempt to evade detection but with adequate threat identification capabilities, behavioural anomalies will be detected. The suspicious activity is triangulated and compared against known bad behaviour to identify the intruder. This process resembles many modern cybersecurity systems that adopt machine-learning (ML) technologies to learn, remember and adapt to combat viruses and bacteria, and to immunise the enterprise from further attacks. Additional steps include considerations of security processes and technical controls that are capable of identifying series threats that could be programmed to trigger an alarm. The next step to include is the development of predictive capabilities to identify motives. The motive behind attacks often reveal repeatable behavioural patterns that will allow the security infrastructure to respond appropriately. Many threats such as malware and command-and-control (C&C) server use the same codebase/framework to penetrate networks even if somewhat disguised or morphed. They share many of the same codebase characteristics and attack cycles, allowing the enterprise defences to predict intent before any damage is done. Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies are often deployed to uncover such behavioural patterns. Once the motive is uncovered, the appropriate incident response can be taken to contain the threat and for further analysis. Much of this is done manually today but with security orchestration and automation tools, these actions can be fully autonomous without additional human input. It’s always useful to seek the expertise of a Managed Security Services Provider (MSSP) to shore up your defences. Trustwave, a Singtel company, is a leading MSSP with industry-leading threat detection and responses services that provide 24X7 around-the-globe delivery, powered by Trustwave SpiderLabs®, and can be tailored to your security needs. Services include innovative SpiderLabs® security research capabilities, threat intelligence, monitoring of SOC, and an intuitive portal to automate cybersecurity management and response. Conventional security frameworks focus on keeping threats and attacks out or away from corporate networks. But with the speed and volume of cyber attacks available today, keeping out network intruders is increasingly difficult. A security framework or model targeted at working within the network, from inside the perimeter would provide comprehensive protection of the enterprise’s entire network infrastructure. Operating much like the human immune system, this new model will emphasise learning and adapting to threat vectors using technologies within. Accordingly, this cybersecurity immune system will respond quickly to provide complete coverage against an attack, detecting the malicious code, analysing it and mitigating the risk with an appropriate action.

                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  In the ever-evolving landscape of technology, where innovation drives the competitive edge, the role of software development has never been more pivotal. Today, we find ourselves at the intersection of ambition and execution, where harnessing the potential of software innovation is a strategic imperative. The question we now face is not whether to embrace AI, but how to wield it as a catalyst for organisational growth. In this white paper, we shall embark on a journey into the realm of AI-assisted programming and how it revolutionises software development. The demand for innovation and efficiency in software development has never been greater. Where most industries depend on software as the linchpin of their operations, AI-assisted programming stands as the harbinger of transformation. At its heart, it involves the integration of advanced AI, epitomised by tools like  , into the software development lifecycle. In the pages that follow, we will explore the ways in which the triple A benefits of  —can manifest both horizontally and vertically. We will delve into how we can usher in a new era of software development through three key value drivers, namely development acceleration, code protection, and developer empowerment. You will gain insights into how AI-assisted programming is crucial in helping companies to maintain a competitive edge. Traditional software development workflows frequently suffer from inefficiencies and bottlenecks, which have a negative impact on project timeframes and results. These workflows are riddled with repetitive coding tasks that drain valuable time, debugging processes that typically catch errors late in the game, and lengthy development cycles that can stifle adaptability to changing market conditions. This section highlights the pressing need for innovation in the software development landscape and sets the stage for examining how AI-assisted programming offers a game-changing remedy to these age-old problems, ushering in an era of unparalleled productivity. AI-assisted programming follows the shift in preference towards agile methodologies – working quickly to make small iterations and get ongoing feedback. Through real-time code suggestions and auto-completion features, these tools simplify the coding process, drastically reducing the need for manual searching and typing. They also assist in the generation of code snippets, the automation of routine coding activities, and the construction of boilerplate code. As such, companies can speed up the software development lifecycle and enable quicker time-to-market in stages such as initiation (code refactoring), requirement & design (user stories generation), construction (code generation), and testing (automated unit test scripts). This automation not only accelerates coding but also improves code quality by minimising syntax errors and ensuring best practices are followed. For example, in the case of automated unit test script generation – AI tools like  and  can analyse the code being developed and provide code suggestions for test cases. It identifies different scenarios and edge cases that should be tested, generating test cases for various input values, corner cases, and boundary conditions. By proactively detecting errors, vulnerabilities, and bugs in real-time, developers reduce the need for debugging efforts later in the development cycle. In a  trial conducted to evaluate the impact of AI on developer productivity, it was revealed that participants with access to the AI pair programmer completed the given task  than the control group . Naturally, the productivity gain would imply a significant amount of cost savings – cost savings in project management that arises from shorter development cycles, and cost reductions associated with bug fixing and maintenance, thereby allowing companies to enjoy significant cost reductions. The dependence on software applications has reached unprecedented heights as technology is increasingly incorporated into every aspect of our life. As a result, the effects of software flaws, hacks, and poor-quality code have increased tremendously. These problems not only pose serious risks to the confidentiality and integrity of data but also have far-reaching repercussions for an organisation’s standing in the public eye, financial security, and legal standing. To navigate this complex and high-stakes terrain, organisations should start recognising the potential of AI-assisted programming in fundamentally altering how code quality and security are maintained throughout the software development lifecycle. In this section, we will delve into the transformative role of AI in ensuring robust code quality and security, safeguarding against potential vulnerabilities, and fortifying the software that underpins our digital future. AI-assisted programming tools like  offer several advantages that go beyond streamlining the software development lifecycle for agile teams. They also contribute to enhancing code security through proactive vulnerability detection and secure code generation. For example,  employs advanced static code analysis and machine learning algorithms to continuously examine the code being written. It proactively identifies potential vulnerabilities, security loopholes, and coding practices that can expose systems to security hazards. By detecting issues in real-time, it reduces the risk of security and data breaches that can damage the company’s reputation and result in legal liabilities. Tools like  can guide developers to adhere to security coding standards and industry best practices. It offers suggestions for secure coding techniques and guidelines for secure authentication, authorisation, and data protection, helping developers write more secure code from the outset. For example, it can detect and recommend encryption techniques for handling sensitive data in compliance with data protection laws like GDPR or suggest secure authentication mechanisms that align with industry standards. Automated checks for compliance with industry standards and regulations help the company avoid costly penalties and legal complications. Promoting clean, well-structured code and automated adherence to coding standards help development teams minimise the accumulation of technical debt over time. They prevent shortcuts, hacks, and workarounds that frequently lead to a complicated web of code, making future updates and maintenance increasingly costly and time-consuming. Conversely, AI-driven suggestions guarantee that code is created in a comprehensive and consistent manner, thereby lessening the cost burden brought on by extensive refactoring, codebase rewrites, and extended development schedules, and hence reducing the danger of technical debt accumulation. No longer confined to the traditional realms of coding and debugging, developers are emerging as creative problem solvers and innovators, driving the very essence of technological advancement. In this section, we delineate how AI-assisted programming tools like  have accelerated and empowered this change in developers’ function, and how these technologies not only speed up development chores but also serve as invaluable mentors, offering on-the-job learning experiences and exposing developers to a breadth of coding styles and techniques. AI-assisted programming tools like  foster on-the-job learning opportunities for developers. These tools, powered by machine learning and code analysis, actively assist developers in real-time, suggesting code snippets and offering insights into best practices and emerging technologies. With recommendations spanning a wide range of programming languages, libraries, and frameworks, developers can diversify their skill set effortlessly. By promoting continuous learning within the development workflow, developers not only gain proficiency in current technologies but also remain primed to embrace emerging trends. This translates to a more innovative and agile organisation, ultimately contributing to the company’s competitive edge and long-term success in the ever-evolving digital landscape. Employees who appreciate professional development may find these tools that assist continual learning and skill improvement appealing. In fact, 71% of workers surveyed in a Gallup study felt that job training and development increased their job satisfaction, and 61% indicated that upskilling opportunities are an important reason to stay at their job. Hence, the use of such tools may in turn result in a higher retention rate. What further establishes the long-term retention of employees is the fact that these tools reduce the monotony commonly associated with repetitive and time-consuming coding tasks. Empowering developers of the future to automate routine tasks and instead focus on more meaningful and intellectually stimulating aspects of their work increases job satisfaction. For instance, a survey conducted revealed that 60-75% developers who utilised  felt more fulfilled with their job, felt less frustrated when coding and were able to focus on more satisfying work. Similarly, 73% of developers reported that the tool helped them stay in the flow, and 87% of them could preserve mental effort during repetitive tasks.1 Overall, offering cutting-edge tools can make a company more attractive to top tech talents, as skilled developers are more likely to stay with a company that provides them with the tools and resources they need to excel in their roles. The ability to attract and retain these talents is crucial today as programmer scarcity is an increasingly pressing concern for organisations, with the global tech talent shortage expected to reach 85.2 million by 2030 . Developer shortage has stalled new projects in recent years, but AI-assisted programming tools like  offer a compelling solution. By upskilling existing talent, Copilot not only mitigates the recruitment pressure but also elevates the company’s agility and cost-efficiency. Developers are provided with instant access to a wealth of coding knowledge, gaining assistance to tasks ranging from routine to complex. The acceleration of development cycles also enables current team members to handle more tasks with greater efficiency. This, in turn, reduces the need for extensive external hiring and helps organisations to navigate the developer shortage with confidence.       From: https://github.blog/2022-09-07-research-quantifying-github-copilots-impact-on-developer-productivity-and-happiness/

NCS and align.me develop GenAI framework to enable businesses to achieve scalability at speed  and align.me develop   framework to enable businesses to achieve scalability at speed Contact Us Thank you for your interest. The challenge  The solution The impact Why NCS? Technology partner Meet our experts Contact us 
                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  NCS in Australia and align.me, a B2B sales and marketing consultancy, have co-developed a pioneering AI orchestration framework that enables businesses to achieve scalability at speed with agentic AI. This will be critical for customers in leveraging generative AI in future, with structure required to manage ‘AI agents’ – autonomous software programs simulating human intelligence to perform tasks, make decisions, and interact with users – effectively. It also enables hyper-personalisation, with transformative benefits for clients who are keen to achieve rapid business growth through automation. Clients will be enabled to “do more with the same” due to automation, rapid experimentation to test and optimise, and having the flexibility to build iterative workflows to adapt to moving client demands. They will also be able to achieve greater scalability with high quality outputs. 
    AI orchestration can radically improve the accuracy and reliability of agent-created outcomes including the ability to amplify creativity, improve cost efficiencies, contribute to time savings, deliver productivity gains and enables rapid iterations that are imperative to business and digital change. “By automating and integrating AI solutions repeatedly and reliably into existing products, we empower our humans to spend more time adding value to clients,” explains Hugh Macfarlane, Founder and CEO of align.me, on his business’ partnership with NCS. The solution will underpin align.me’s go-to-market planning platform and aligns with its ambitious business growth plans, using Amazon Bedrock as a fully managed service to develop GenAI with security, privacy, and responsible AI considerations in mind. It may also be an integral foundation for further AI solutions, dashboards and integrations developed by NCS. 
  align.me supports growing businesses and enterprise clients with B2B sales and marketing that keeps buyers front and centre of all plans, and also works with ecosystem vendors – mostly in IT – to execute successful sales and marketing activities. While based locally in Melbourne, its tech-savvy team already leverages AI to support clients in some 45 countries. An array of AI agents are already deployed by align.me in a cloud-based go-to-market planning application that’s enabled its team to achieve efficiencies and improve the quality of outputs for collaborators. “These agents have allowed us to distribute knowledge and skills that were previously tightly held and put those skills in the hands of a network of consultants who hold other skills and relationships and other languages globally,” says Hugh. “The challenge has been all of our AI agents have been ‘single-shot’, largely serving a narrow purpose and being manually orchestrated by our own application. This has made improvements slow as we’ve been unable to run side-by-side tests to optimise models, parameters, prompts, pre-trained RAG, or data. It has also been slow for us to rearchitect processes. Effective AI orchestration can be wickedly expensive too.” 
  The innovative framework provides an orchestration layer on top of the foundation models and APIs surfaced with AWS Bedrock and enables detailed mechanisms for control and orchestration, which is how agents are provided with data, instructions, foundation models, parameters, and outputs, along with the order in which those agents interact. This allows for dynamic and repeatable generation of outputs and content. This enables align.me to fine-tune and deliver highly optimised AI agents that deliver hyper-personalised guidance to clients. Growth at scale is enabled with greater control at an input level and fewer challenges due to script orchestration too. The solution enables deeper, high quality AI orchestration with less likelihood of AI bias and hallucinations. Each ‘AI agent’ had previously worked sequentially, but now each agent can “talk” to each other in a myriad of different ways, with deeper integration to achieve common goals and higher control over both the metadata and parameters. Fine-tuning is achievable, unlocking micro-level personalisation and segmentation for different clients and use cases. 
  The solution will give align.me’s team capacity for rapidly iterating and evolving how it uses AI to deliver scalable sales and marketing guidance to clients that enable faster, more efficient decision making informed by intelligent business insights. Cost efficiencies will be gained with greater control by clients over “how and when” AI agents operate. Tasks can be handled in a way that minimises waste and optimises performance. Longer term, enhancements to cost tracking and attribution will be achievable. There will also be continuous improvements and data-driven optimisations through smarter testing of prompts, agents and flows. “As a first use case for this orchestration, NCS’s data scientists will also be adding a new capability for our go-to-market planning application to enrich the planning discussions with an analysis of how competitors are representing their capabilities in similar domains so that our consultants can more easily help our planning clients to find ‘clear air’ – a space they can dominate,” says Hugh. “It will help improve the richness of planning decisions.” Through effective use of agentic AI, employee productivity gains are also possible. As examples: align.me anticipates to realise all of these benefits through this collaborative work with NCS, and more. Pursuing enhancements with AI is also integral to align.me retaining its competitive edge in an evolving marketing landscape. “We expect to reduce the time we presently take to ideate, scope, experiment, and operationalise single agents from three months to three weeks per employed agent,” says Hugh. “The orchestration of those agents (which agents operate and the order in which the agents operate) adds further benefits that we can’t quantify because we simply can’t do that today.” At a time Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has gone as far as to predict in his book   that 95% of what marketers use agencies, strategists and creative professionals for will be handled by AI at nearly no cost in future, digital transformation – including embracing AI in a purposeful and strategic way – makes good business sense in the marketing sector. “Scalability is as important for us as a B2B sales and marketing consultancy as it is for our clients,” says Hugh. “By enhancing our AI capabilities and codifying some of our underlying intellectual property, our capacity to serve companies globally through our finite local consultancy network is going to rapidly increase. That’s powerful, and that’s what’s achievable with the strategic use of technology and a partner alongside us like NCS.” 
  Choosing NCS, a trusted technology services business that’s also an Amazon Web Services (AWS) Premium Partner, was a natural fit for align.me. Since reaching this AWS partner status more than a decade ago, NCS has consistently demonstrated the highest level of specialisation,  , and a proven track record of customer success across all AWS validated qualifications. align.me has worked closely with NCS Australia’s team, including AWS National Sales Lead,   and consultants in our  , to engineer a framework that will deliver long-term results. “We’ve really enjoyed working closely with NCS Australia’s talented and hardworking team,” says Hugh. “NCS’s data scientists have built an orchestration framework that will allow us to treat agents as objects, passing data and requests to one, having it interact with other special-purpose agents, having them collaborate, and even experiment with the order in which agents collaborate on outcome.” Share this article on: Acronis unifies data protection and cybersecurity, delivering cyber protection that solves

The Power of Design Thinking | NCS AU the power of design thinking Contact Us Thank you for your interest. The importance of empathy Design thinking from the ground up explore more 
                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  When design agency IDEO was tasked by bicycle components manufacturer Shimano to find out why 90 percent of Americans don’t ride bikes, the team set out to talk to consumers from all walks of life. They discovered that most people were intimidated by cycling—everything from the retail experience to the cost and complexity of bikes and accessories to the danger of cycling on roads was daunting. Based on this, Shimano designed a simpler bicycle targeted at people who cycle for leisure, changed its retail strategy in stores, and launched a campaign to identify safe cycling routes, IDEO CEO Tim Brown told the Harvard Business Review 1. This problem-solving strategy, known as design thinking, places the end-user at the front and centre of the innovation and product development process. First popularised in product design circles, design thinking is now widely used in many other sectors, including government, healthcare, finance and IT. As with physical consumer products, design thinking in IT is about adopting a human-centric focus when designing solutions. It is an approach that begins with a discovery phase of the customers to understand their needs, and where problems are identified. Solutions are then shaped and prototyped to test for user desirability, business viability and technical feasibility, and then realised through agile development. At the heart of design thinking is empathy. Design-driven organisations, whether they are in technology, advertising or the public service, make it their mission to walk a mile in the shoes of their stakeholders, so as to discover and address their needs and the challenges they face. At NCS, leaders from all units undergo design thinking training, during which they put themselves in the shoes of both their customers and employees to innovate, design and prototype solutions. For example, an NCS project team developing an IT system for a customer service centre paid the centre a visit, posing as a customer. This experience helped them to better understand how the client and its customers interact with the IT system, and to experience firsthand how the system’s performance affects the user experience. In another instance, the corporate team put themselves in the position of the management team, and gained a much better understanding of the types of reports they needed. While nearly all companies will assure their customers that they are the main focus, reality is often quite different — business decisions made at the upper echelons of management sometimes give short shrift to the needs and concerns of end-users. Companies that are serious about design thinking, however, go above and beyond finding out what customers want to finding out why they want it, write McKinsey experts Jennifer Kilian, Hugo Sarrazin and Hyo Yeon2. This is why tech companies like Google, Intel and Microsoft are hiring anthropologists and ethnographers, and why many have armies of designers on their payroll. While ease of use, simplicity and intuitiveness are now de rigueur when it comes to user interface and user experience, these are not the only parts of the tech stack that would benefit from good design. Design thinking should start at the very bottom of the stack, encompassing all layers from foundational architecture to hardware, networking, software and data management. Just as a chain is only as strong as its weakest link, a poorly designed underlying layer could throw off even the most elegantly designed user interface. In the past, designers were often only called upon near the end of the development process, and tasked with making the end product look more aesthetically pleasing and attractive to consumers. Today, however, many organisations recognise that design thinking should play a substantive role from the very beginning of the development process. The need for a coherent, holistic design necessitates a multidisciplinary and collaborative working environment — programmers, data scientists, developers, engineers, designers and marketing personnel can no longer afford to stay in their own departmental bubbles during the product development process. Restructuring organisational processes around design thinking is hard work, and may require some persuasion to change mindsets. Ultimately, however, the payoffs are well worth the trouble: more satisfied customers, new opportunities to grow the business, enhanced collaboration and a strong culture of innovation. When combined with our other core capabilities, design thinking will let us differentiate our products and solutions at every stage of our operations. It enables us to collaborate more closely with our customers as we contribute our expertise and implement new ideas to solve their problems.

Five signs that you need to look into digital transformation now | NCS AU five signs that you need to look into digital transformation now Contact Us Thank you for your interest. 1. Customers’ frustrations are loud and urgent 2. Your employees cannot do their jobs properly 3. You take twice as long as the new kid on the block to get something done 4. You are still using “pre-Internet” technologies, systems and processes 5. You are data-rich but insights-poor explore more 
                what are you looking for?
             You can drop us a call or email Published:  Are you still indecisive over your digital transformation priorities? Many organisations are held back in their efforts by the inability to decide on goals, difficulty in justifying budgets, bewilderment over new technologies, lack of digital capabilities, and the list goes on. At NCS Digital, we work with clients across many industries to address these issues. Where in your organisation should you start? Here are five signs to look out for. Any of these would be good areas to kickstart your digital initiatives. Take a look at your Net Promoter Score or any other measure of customer satisfaction. In this digital age, your customers will be all too ready to share the experience that they have had with your brand. They will share it with their friends and their networks, and they will do so publicly. Digitally-savvy customers expect their experience with you to be on par with the best-of-breed Internet companies that they have interacted with. If your customer touchpoints are getting negative feedback, you should be taking a look at how customer experience powered by digital technology can help you to address customers’ frustrations, boost customer scores, increase retention and make a positive impact on your top line. Reimagine how you can transform your customers’ experience with your products and services. Employees are the ones who deliver that “moment of truth” to customers every day. If your employees are encountering obstacles in their work to the point that they lack motivation to do their job well, customer experience will invariably be impacted. A common bugbear that affects employee morale is the time they have to spend dealing with manual, paper-based or convoluted processes. This takes them away from time that could be better spent with the customer. So start by looking at how the introduction of the right digital technologies can help to improve your employees’ experience at work - what needs to be in place to create a digital workplace that will support your employees in the digital economy. An upstart has entered your turf and is making waves. It seems to be able to move much faster than you can - whether onboarding a new customer or bringing a new product to market. One reason for this could be that, as a new company, it had the opportunity to design its business and processes from ground up and apply a new set of technologies to help it work faster and more efficiently and to introduce business innovation. You will need to do the same. Take a look at areas in your own organisation where business processes can be re-drawn to deliver business agility. Removing paper-based processes and applying digital technology to augment your middle or back-office operations is another area of digital transformation that can deliver clear, efficient outcomes. Past track record is no guarantee of future success. Your organisation may have been highly successful for many years, and you may be running systems that were best-of-breed when you implemented them, but the landscape has changed. Today, advances in digital technologies allow you to provision services on-demand, scale rapidly and design your applications differently. Many of these technologies are now mature enough to deliver enterprise-grade services, and some of the largest companies in the world today depend on them to run their global operations. It is therefore time for you to review your technology stack. Look for opportunities to modernise your IT infrastructure and systems to take full advantage of new digital capabilities. How can you move to the cloud, what should you move to the cloud? How can cloud technologies improve your business? These are the conversations you need to start having now. The decreasing cost of data storage has made it easier for organisations to collect more and more data. However, data quantity does not automatically translate into useful insights that can support decision-making. Despite the amount of data that some organisations are collecting, their lines of business may still be far from making data-driven decisions. One reason could be that they do not know why they are collecting the data that they are collecting, how they can extract useful and actionable insights from it and, most importantly, connect those insights to make sound business decisions. If this is the situation in your organisation, it is time to develop a robust data strategy. You need a proper plan to ensure you are making the right investments in data and analytics to fuel your business.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  AI is here, and it's not just a buzzword – it's transforming industries and redefining how we do business. But with this power comes the need for smart, ethical governance. My team joined Australian directors and business leaders recently at the AICD Governance Summit to discuss exactly that – the opportunity for Australian businesses to embrace AI responsibly and thoughtfully. I also note the acknowledgement by Treasurer Jim Chalmers following the recent election, speaking about the critical role of technology like AI in fuelling Australian business growth. Spoiler: It’s not just about tech. Good AI governance is found in the leaders who build AI-powered businesses responsibly, with foresight for workforce transformation and planning for digital resilience. Australia’s growing fluency in AI is not only transforming industries but also positioning Australia as a key player in the global AI landscape. Businesses large and small are evaluating and deploying the technology to drive innovation and productivity. As CB Insights’ $1B+ Market Map also shows, nearly 1 in 2 unicorns is an AI company and Australia is home to eight of the world’s 1,249 unicorns where these teams created AI-powered robotics, coding agents, and generative creative engines. We are home to a community of strong AI capability and credibility on the global stage. But more broadly Australian business leaders and their businesses have room to grow their trust and fluency in AI. Recent news reports show that just 30 per cent of Australians believe the benefits of using artificial intelligence outweigh the risks, the lowest ranking of any country in a global survey of 47 nations. Globally, there are lessons we can learn from the applications of AI. Japan has pioneered the use of humanoid robots and AI in manufacturing, driven by its aging population and strong industrial base. China leads in generative AI patents and has seen major tech companies like Alibaba, Tencent, and Baidu develop advanced AI models. In Singapore, AI is being applied to strengthen career support for jobseekers with Virtual Career Coach tools accessing advice based on career goals, interests and existing skills to direct them to relevant roles, skills development programs and career planning.2 AI initiatives like these show AI’s potential for economic, industrial and social benefit in incredibly impactful ways. AI adoption should be driven by a culture of responsible ambition. At the AI Action Summit in Paris in February, Australia was one of 60 countries pledging to regulate the fast-emerging world of AI to “ensure AI is open, inclusive, transparent, ethical, safe, secure, and trustworthy.” Boards and executives must encourage innovation and maintain a strong focus on governance, fostering a culture where ethical AI practices are the norm: A trusted digital core to an organisation. Responsible ambition means pushing the boundaries of what AI can achieve, while safeguarding against potential risks. Aligning AI initiatives with the core purpose and mission of an organisation is critical. And asking key questions about how AI can enhance capability to deliver value is the most important first step. A piecemeal approach to AI can cause fragmented efforts and poor results, while a comprehensive strategy ensures coherence and strengthens digital resilience. AI will also inevitably transform the workforce. Businesses must be proactive in managing this change, upskilling employees, and fostering a culture of continuous learning; ensuring AI complements rather than replaces human capabilities. Ethical considerations such as data privacy, bias mitigation, and accountability must also be at the forefront of AI initiatives and training, ensuring that employees are equipped to optimise AI’s value thoughtfully and ethically. The AI revolution presents both opportunities and challenges for Australian businesses. As we stand on the brink of this transformative era, join me in the call for thoughtful, ethical governance of AI to be the standard. Let’s unlock the opportunity AI presents for boards, business leaders and society at large, ensuring we do so ethically, safely and securely.    NCS Australia, Country Manager Share this article on:   If you're ready to make it happen, get in touch today.

             You can drop us a call or email Published:  
Kevin Wilson, NCS’ Practice Director for Data and AI, recently spoke about accelerating data transformation – which is front of mind for many organisations as they plan for the future – at   in San Francisco. In this Q&A, he shares some best practices for governance, agility and innovation with data management. 
  First up, data silos. This is a classic challenge that’s been around for decades and, believe it or not, it’s still one of the biggest hurdles today. Then there’s data quality –making sure your data is accurate, complete, and trusted by the business.  Governance is another key area. Many organisations struggle to keep track of what data they have, who can access it, and where it’s stored, which increases the risk of data breaches and compliance issues.  And finally, even with the right technology in place, many teams still find it difficult to demonstrate real business value from their data platform. 
  True data transformation starts with a clear vision, strong governance, and a culture that embraces change and innovation. It can help to start small, learn fast, and scale with confidence. Clarity of purpose, design discipline, and a roadmap that puts business value first – not starting with your technology – is also important.    Our clients value the deep technical expertise we bring, helping them move faster with ready-to-use solution accelerators and proven strategies. 
  To truly unlock business value from your data platform, it’s important to look beyond just the technology. We’ve found that success comes from focusing on five key areas that work together to drive real impact.  By focusing on these five areas, you set yourself up not just for technical success, but for real, sustainable business value from your data platform.  We have a strategic partnership with Databricks, empowering customers to leverage a unified data and AI platform that accelerates their data strategies while ensuring robust governance and security. Google, Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft are also among our strategic  . So, we can offer agility and flexibility with how we work with you to maximise value, based on your unique requirements.   If you are curious about how our team can accelerate your data journey – reach out today.  |   |   |  Practice Lead, Data and AI, NCS Australia Share this article on: Our case studies showcasing what we have delivered and the value we bring to business We can help you plot your route and navigate safely through every stage.
